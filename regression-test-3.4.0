TopoDroid Regression Tests

This is an incomplete list of things to check 

[x] install apk over an existing installation and check that it starts
    preserving the user preferences - Checked 4 customized configurations (Rodrigo)

LANGUAGES
[x] es [x] fr [x] de [x] it [x] cn [x] bg [x] ru [x] ua [x] sl [x] pt [x] hu
Changed the language setting and confirmed that the language of the configuration windows changed. I can't recognize bg, ru and ua but there are 3 different languages that I don't recognize on the language settings also so I believe they are these 3 ;) (Rodrigo)

MAIN WINDOW
[ ] activity level
    [x] buttons presence according to the "activity-level" - So no change on the main window but I believe that's what's expected for this windows in particular (Rodrigo)
    [ ] functionalities enabled by the activity-level

    [ ] level-0 (basic)
    [ ] level-1 (normal)
    [ ] level-2 (advanced)
    [ ] level-3 (experimental)

    [x] on changing language the settings are updated to the new language
[x] current work directory
    [x] enter a name of non-existing directory: check it is created and properly populated of subdirs
        this happens also if the cwd is set, the app is shit down, the directory is deleted, the app is restarted
    [x] enter a name without "topodroid": this must be prepended to the dir name
    [x] enter a name with prefix "topodroid": this is not prepended to the dir name It works as expected if the prefix is exactly "TOpoDroid" casa sensitive. (Rodrigo)
