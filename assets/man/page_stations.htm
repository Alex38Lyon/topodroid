<h4>Current station</h4>
The "current" station is the station from which the survey will continue.
If you have set the current station, TopoDroid will continue numbering stations from it. If the current station is not set, the last one is used.<br><p>

Thus you can start a branch in the middle of the survey by selecting the station you want to attach as current station. To set the current station long tap on the station name in the shot list (a normal tap toggles the display of the relevant splay shots when the display of splays is globally disabled). The current station is highlighted green in the shot data window. A long tap on another station switches the current station. A long tap on the current station turns it off. Alternatively, you can replace the from station of the first shot of the branch, afterwards.<br><p>

You can set the current station in three ways
<ul>
<li>with a long tap on the station name in the shot data window.</li>
<li>through the station point edit dialog in the sketch window.</li>
<li>selecting the station from the saved stations</li>
</ul> 

<h4>Saved stations</h4>

The "saved stations" are stations saved for later reference, eg, at a crossway, to go back and continue the
survey from there, or to mark a possible lead to check in a future trip.
The dialog displays the list of saved stations. You select one by tapping it. 
The selected station is shown in the text fields. Initially there is the 
last station, or the current station if set.
Each saved station must have a brief description or comment.<br><p>

The buttons acts on the selected station: 
<ul>
<li>clear the text boxes</li>
<li>save the station in  the text-box, if not already saved, or update the comment</li>
<li>set the current station to that in the text-box (or clear it, if the text-box is empty)</li>
<li>delete the saved station</li>
</ul><br><p>
