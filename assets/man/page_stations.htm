<h4>SAVED STATIONS [N]</h4>
The "saved stations" are stations saved for later reference, eg, at a crossway, to go back and continue the
survey from there, or to mark a possible lead to check in a future trip.
The dialog displays the list of saved stations. You select one by tapping it. 
The selected station is shown in the text fields. Initially there is the 
last station, or the current station if set.
Each saved station must have a brief description or comment.<br><p>

The buttons acts on the selected station: 
<ul>
<li>clear the text boxes</li>
<li>save the station in  the text-box, if not already saved, or update the comment</li>
<li>set the current station to that in the text-box (or clear it, if the text-box is empty)</li>
<li>delete the saved station</li>
</ul><br><p>
