<h3>New sketch dialog</h3>

When you tap the "New sketch" button in the "Sketch list" dialog you are brought to the "New sketch" dialog.<br><p>

This dialog has two text field and a confirmation button.
<ul>
<li><b>name</b> is the name assigned to the sketch.</li>
<li><b>origin station</b></li>
</ul><br><p>

You can use either the <b>name</b> suggested by TopoDroid
(an increasing integer number) or enter a mnemonic name. Each sketch is saved with two files, one for the plan,
the other for the profile. The filenames are obtained composing the survey name, the sketch name, and a suffix 
("p" for plan, "s" for profile). For example the sketch "2" of the survey "cave" is saved in the two files
"cave-2p.th2" and "cave-2s.th2" (if you choose to save the sketch in Therion format).<br><p>


The <b>origin station</b> defines how the sketch is translated with respect to the survey midline.
The sketch reference the survey midline defines the sketch scale and rotation, but leaves undefined
how the drawing is translated with respect to the midline. This uncertanty is resolved by specifying the
<b>origin station</b>: this station has coordinates (0,0) in the reference frame of the sketch canvas.<br><p>

The <b>origin station</b> also determines the survey midline data reduction for the sketch. From the sketch point of view
the midline is built starting from the origin station and continuing as long as data can be attached. The resulting midline
forms a tree, rooted at the origin station. In order to make the canvas less cluttered, 
is possible to hide the display of portion of the midline, either
after a station, or before it (ie, between the origin station and the station).
This is explained in the "Sketch station" dialog.<br><p>
