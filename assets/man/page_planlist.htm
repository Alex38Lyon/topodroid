<h3>Sketch list dialog</h3>

The "Sketch" button (the "picture") in the "Shot list" window opens the "Sketch list" dialog.<br><p>

This dialog has a button to create a new sketch and the list of the existing sketches of the survey.<br><p>

Tap the "New sketch" button if you need to create a new sketch. This takes you to another dialog, where you can enter the
sketch information, before opening the "Sketch" window, where you can draw and edit the sketch.<br><p>

The list of the existing sketches has two columns: the left one is for the plan views and the right one for the
profile views. Each sketch consists of a plan and a profile view, therefore it is listed in both columns.<br><p>

To open a sketch tap its entry in one of the two columns. If you tap the entry in the left column (plans) the 
sketch is opened in the plan view. If you tap the entry in the right column (profiles) the sketch is opened in the
profile view.<br><p>
