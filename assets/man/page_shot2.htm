<h4>Secondary shot edit</h4>

A long tap on a shot line opens another dialog with buttons for the following action(s):<br>
<img src="shot_dialog_btn1.png"><br>
<ul>
<li>take a <u>photo</u>: [A] this starts the Camera app, to take a picture. You should add a note to the picture, to remind you later what it is about</li>
<li>take a <u>measurement</u> [A] with the Android device sensors, or to enter data taken with an external apparatus</li>
<li><u>add</u> [A] a shot before it</li>
<li><u>split</u> [A] the survey at the shot. This opens a dialog to enter the info for the new survey. Starting from this shot the survey data are assigned to the new survey. Afterwards the program continues with the new survey. You may need to split surveys when you have data from two (separate) survey pieces stored in the DistoX: these are downloaded to a single survey which must be then split accordingly.</li>
<li><u>delete</u> the shot (the shot is not really deleted, just marked as such, and can be recovered)</li>
</ul><br><p>


<b>Photos</b><br>
When you choose to take a picture at a shot, you must first enter a brief comment of the photo, then you can take the photo (with the Camera app).  The survey photos are stored in the subdirectory of <i>TopoDroid/photo</i> with the name of the survey. Each photo record is automatically timestamped.<br>
The list of the survey photos is displayed with the <u>Photo</u> button of the <u>Survey Info</u> window. Tapping an item on the list a dialog is shown to edit the photo comment, or to delete the photo.<br><p>

<b>Sensor measurements</b><br>
With the <u>Measurement</u> dialog you can record the value of a measure taken with an Android sensor, and store it associated to the shot, ie, localized with respect to the survey. Each measurement is automatically timestamped. You can also enter values taken with external devices, provided you specify a "type" name.<br>
The list of measurements is displayed with the <u>Sensor</u> button of the <u>Survey Info</u> window.<br><p>
