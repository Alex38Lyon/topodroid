<h4>Drawing reference dialog</h4>

The "Drawing reference" dialog is opened by the "reference" button (the "three drawers" icon) of the
"Sketch" window or the "Overview" window.<br><p>

This dialog has four check boxes to specify whether to display or not the items of reference type:
<ul>
<li><b>legs</b> for the survey midline (white lines)</li>
<li><b>splays</b> for the splay shots (grey)</li>
<li><b>stations</b> names (violet)</li>
<li><b>grid</b> the metric (or yard) grid</li>
</ul>

The sketch cambas has three levels of grids.<br>
<ol>
<li>a grid at 1 m spacing (dark grey)</li>
<li>a grid at 10 m spacing (grey)</li>
<li>a grid at 100 m spacing (light grey)</li>
</ol>
<br><p>

TopoDroid shows only the grids that are appropriate for the scale of the sketch view.
<br><p>

A fifth checkbox [experimental level] specifies whether the reference should be help fixed when
shifting the drawing with two fingers. This is used to adjust a PocketTopo imported drawing to the reference
in the case it gets imported with a translation.<br><p>
