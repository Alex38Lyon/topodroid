<h4>Sketch station</h4>

This dialog has these actions:
<ul>
<li>make the station "active", ie, continue the survey from this station.</li>
<li>show the hidden midline (if applicable)</li>
<li>toggle the display of the splay shots at the station</li>
<li>at-station x-section buttons</li>
</ul>


<b>Active station</b><br>
The "active" station is where the next downloaded shots will be attached. When a leg is downloaded (or inserted) the new station becomes the "active" station. By changing the "active" station you can continue surveying from a station in the middle of the survey.<br><p>

<b>Midline hiding</b><br>
Hiding parts of the midline is useful when the survey is complicated or goes over itself.
In this case you may want to see only a part of the midline.
If a portion of midline behind a station is hidden, the station is shown red or violet.
They are violet if the hidden part of the midline lies between them and the sketch origin station.
Otherwise they are red.
Stations in the part of midline behind a "red" station, are not automatically saved as Therion station points. Therefore, by choosing the sketch origin station inside the scrap and marking stations as barrier you can avoid spurious stations in the scrap file.
<br>
The display of the midline can be limited through the property edit dialog of leg shots.
When a portion of midline starting at the station is hidden, there is a button to revert and show it.<br><p>

<b>At-station cross-section</b><br>
Cross sections can be created at stations.
X-sections in plan view are in the vertical plane (their plane is determined bygiving the azimuth).
In profile view, x-section can have an inclination. However when selected through the "stations" checkboxes
they are vertical if the legs inclination is below a specified value (a setting), otherwise they are
horizontal.
<br>

If the station has only two legs attached the plane of the cross-section can be inferred by TopoDroid
(the bisecant of the angle between the two legs, or perpendicular to the leg of there is only one).
There remains only the ambiguity about from which side
of the plane the x-section is looked at. This is resolved providing two buttons that specify the direction of 
view with a pair of stations.
<br>

With the last button the user can pick the x-section direction pointing with the android camera.
