<h4>Sketch station editing</h4>

The sketch station point edit dialog has four actions:
<ul>
<li>make the station "current", ie, continue the survey from this station.</li>
<li>hide the midline display "after" the station</li>
<li>hide the midline display "before" the station</li>
<li>toggle the display of the splay shots at the station</li>
</ul>


<b>Current station</b><br>
The "current" station is where the next downloaded shots will be attached. When a leg is downloaded (or inserted) the new station becomes the "current" station. By changing the "current" station you can continue surveying from a station in the middle of the survey.<br><p>

<b>Midline hiding</b><br>
Hiding stations [A] limits the display of the midline for this sketch. This is useful if when the survey is complicated or goes over itself. In this case you might want to see only a part of the midline. Select a station and tap the <u>note</u> button. Then you have the option to hide the previous or next stations. Repeat to show them again.
Stations that limit the midline are colored in blue (when the previous are hidden) or red (when the next are hidden).<br>
