<h4>BACKUP COPIES</h4>
TopoDroid keep a set of four backup copies for each sketch file. These are named with suffixes "bck", "bck0", "bck1", and "bck2" and are stored in the <i>th2</i> subdirectory. Whenever a sketch is saved the backup copies are rotated (eg, "bck1" is renamed "bck2", and so on; "bck" is renamed "bck0"), the old "th2" file is renamed with suffix "bck", and the sketch is saved to a new "th2" file.<br><p>

TopoDroid saves a sketch whenever it is modified (eg, a new item is added, or part of the sketch is erased) while it is open. Only one backup is used in this case: the old saved copy being renamed with suffix "bck".<br><p>

The sketch is saved only if you have made changes to it, otherwise it is not saved and the backup copies are not rotated.<br><p>

When you need to recover a sketch you can choose which copy to load. The dialog displays the backup files and their sizes. Select the backup copy and tap the "OK" button.<br><p>
