<h4>Sketch Reload dialog</h4>

The "Sketch reload" dialog is opened by the "Reload" menu of the "sketch" window.
<br><p>

TopoDroid maintains backup copies of sketch files, from which the sketch can be recovered.<br>
TopoDroid keeps a set of four backup copies for each sketch file.
These are named with suffixes "bck", "bck0", "bck1", and "bck2" and are stored in the <i>th2</i> (Therion files)
or <i>tdr</i> (binary files) subdirectory. Whenever a sketch is saved the backup copies are rotated
(eg, "bck1" is renamed "bck2", and so on; "bck" is renamed "bck0"),
the old "th2" or "tdr" file is renamed with suffix "bck", and the sketch is saved to a new "th2" or "tdr" file.
<br><p>

TopoDroid saves a sketch whenever it is modified (eg, a new item is added, or part of the sketch is erased)
while it is open. Only one backup is used in this case: the old saved copy being renamed with suffix "bck".
<br><p>

The sketch is saved only if you have made changes to it, otherwise it is not saved and the backup copies are not rotated.
<br><p>

The "Sketch reload" dialog shows the list of the sketch backups. Each entry has:<br>
<ul>
<li>the size of the file (in bytes)</li>
<li>how long ago it was written, with suffixes for minutes (m), hours (h), days (d), months (M) and years (Y)</li>
<li>the filename</li>
</ul>
<br><p> 

To recover a sketch you choose which copy to load. 
The filename is shown above the list.
Next you tap the <b>OK</b> button to confirm the choice.<br>
The <b>Back</b> key closes the dialog without reloading the sketch.
