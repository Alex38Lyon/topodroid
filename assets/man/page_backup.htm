<h4>SKETCH RELOAD</h4>

This window is opened by the <u>Reload</u> menu of the <u>sketch window</u>.<br><p>

TopoDroid maintains backup copies of sketch files, from which the sketch can be recovered.<br>
TopoDroid keeps a set of backup copies for each sketch file.
These are named with suffixes "bck", "bck0", "bck1", and so on. They are stored in the 
<i>tdr</i> subdirectory (binary sketch files). Whenever a sketch is saved the backup copies are rotated
(eg, "bck1" is renamed "bck2", and so on; "bck" is renamed "bck0"),
the old "tdr" file is renamed with suffix "bck", and the sketch is saved to a new "tdr" file.
<br><p>

TopoDroid saves a sketch whenever it is modified (eg, a new item is added, or part of the sketch is erased)
while it is open, but no more frequently than a given setting. The deafault in no more tan once in a minute.
 Only one backup is used in this case: the old saved copy being renamed with suffix "bck".
<br><p>

When you switch between plan and profile view, or to and from a cross-section,
and when you close the sketch window, the open view is saved.
<br><p>

The window displays a preview of the sketch backups.
One backup at a time is diaplayed. Some info about the backup are shown in the title: 
<ul>
<li>how long ago it was written, with suffixes for minutes (m), hours (h), days (d), months (M) and years (Y)</li>
<li>size of the file, in square brackets, in bytes</li>
<li>backup number</li>
</ul>
<br><p> 

There are two buttons to move back and forth in the backup list.
<br><p>

The menus are
<ul>
<li><i>close</i> the window without reloading the sketch from a backup</li>
<li><i>reload</i> the sketch from the displayed backup (and close the window)</li>
<li><i>help</i></li>
</ul><br><p>
