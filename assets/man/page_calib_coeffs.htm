<h4>Calibration coefficients</h4>

This dialog displays the 24 coefficients of the calibration linear transformations for the <b>G</b> and the <b>M</b> vectors (12 coefficients each) and 3 coefficients of the non-linear terms (only DistoX2 v. 2.3 or higher). Next there are the average, the std deviation, and the maximum data errors. Finally, the number of iterations taken by the calibration computation.i<br><p>

The error of a calibration data is the angle between the data and the average vector of the group the data belongs to, after having taken the calibration correction into account. The errors are reported in degrees.<br><p>

The dialog has a button to <b>write</b> the coefficients to the DistoX.<br><p>
