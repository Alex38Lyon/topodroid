<h4>DistoX FIRMWARE</h4>

TopoDroid includes the DistoX2 firmwares v. 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5, which are all compatible with hardware 1.0.
Through the firmware dialog you can save a copy of the current firmware of your DistoX2, or upload a new firmware file.
Before uploading a new firmware TopoDroid checks that it is compatible with the hardware version.
Unfortunately there is no sure way to read the firmware version from the file content;
TopoDroid relies on the signature in the file after the bootloader blocks.<br><p>

To prevent uploading a bad file, TopoDroid compares the checksum of the firmware file
with the values of the known firmwares.<br>
Check result codes (negative for failure):
<ul>
<li>2100: firmware 2.1</li>
<li>2200: firmware 2.2</li>
<li>2300: firmware 2.3</li>
<li>2400: firmware 2.4</li>
<li>2512: firmware 2.4c</li>
<li>2500: firmware 2.5</li>
<li>2501: firmware 2.5c</li>
<li>2512: firmware 2.51</li>
<li>-200: failed either 2.1 or 2.2</li>
<li>-230, -2300: failed 2.3</li>
<li>-240, -2400: failed 2.4</li>
<li>-250: failed either 2.5 or 2.51</li>
<li>-246, -2412: failed 2.4c</li>
<li>-256, -2512: failed 2.5c</li>
<li>-27: generic failure</li>
</ul>

The DistoX2 must be booted in "bootloader mode". Refer to the DistoX2 documentation for details.<br>
<b>WARNING. UPLOADING AN INCOMPATIBLE FIRMWARE MAKES YOUR DistoX UNUSABLE.</b><br><p>

Upon uploading a firmware, TopoDroid displays a message saying how many bytes have been written to the DistoX.
If these are less than the firmware file size, the upload has failed.<br><p> 

<b>Firmware update procedure</b><br>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the DistoX is the selected active DistoX in TopoDroid</li>
<li>Open the firmware dialog ("Firmware" menu) and select the firmware file to upload</li>
<li>Check version of hardware and firmware of your DistoX: make sure laser is switched off (CLR) and press FUNC twice to show the version. You may also check the DistoX firmware and hardware versions with TopoDroid device info dialog.</li>
<li>Switch off the DistoX, and switch it on in bootloader mode: press PLUS, MINUS and DIST together. 
The display illumination switches on, but the screen remains empty.</li>
<li>Upload the new firmware with TopoDroid</li>
<li>Switch off the DistoX by pressing CLR</li>
<li>Switch the DistoX on and check the new firmware version.</li>
</ol>

<b>Note</b><br>
The firmware updates are always logged in the TopoDroid log file.<br><p>
