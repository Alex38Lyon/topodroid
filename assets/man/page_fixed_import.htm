<h3>LOCATION IMPORT</h3>

This dialog is opened from the <i>Import</i> button of the <a href="page_fixed_list.htm">Location</a> dialog.<br><p>

With this dialog you can import in 
TopoDroid the coordinates of a point from a <i>MobileTopographer</i> point list file.<br><p>

<ol>
<li>Open <i>MobileTopographer</i> and find the point coordinates ("flag" icon on the left).</li>
<li>When you have reached a sufficient accuracy in the coordinates, save the point (third icon, "doc with plus").</li>
<li>Save the list (fourth icon, "diskette"). The file is saved in "MobileTopographer/pointlist"</li>
<li>Import the coordinates in TopoDroid. The saved points are shown in a list; tap on the point to import.</li>
</ol>

Optionally, you can go to the list of saved points in <i>MobileTopographer</i> (fourth icon, "doc"), and
move the point you just got to the top with the green arrows.<br><p>
