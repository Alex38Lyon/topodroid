<h4>Extend reference</h4>

When a new shot is downloaded TopoDroid sets its "extend" automatically. This holds also for shots entered manually, without specifying the "extend" in the shot dialog. By default the "extend" is either LEFT, RIGHT, or VERT (vertical), depending on the angle the shot makes with a reference azimuth. The "Extend Reference" dialog allows to change the reference azimuth, by rotating it clockwise or counterclockwise. Alternatively, the reference azimuth can be set using the Android compass sensors.<br><p>

It is also possible to fix the "extend" for coming shots to either LEFT or RIGHT, by selecting the appropriate buttons in the dialog.<br><p>
