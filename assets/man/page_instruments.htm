<h4>Instruments calibration dialog</h4>
This dialog lets you specify the values of instruments calibrations for manually entered shots. These values are subtracted to the measured values entered in the shot data dialog, and are taken with the same units as the shot data. For example (supposing we are using meters) a calibration length of 1.0 means that the tape value is 1.0 m short, ie, measurements are taken from the 1 m mark.<br><p>

The calibration values are cleared whenever a survey is opened.<br><p>
