<h3>[11] SKETCH WINDOW</h3>

The first time you tap the Sketch button the dialog you get contains only the "New Sketch" button. Tap on it. The coming dialog contains two fields:
<ul>
<li>the sketch <u>name</u>. TopoDroid suggest a number, and you can safely leave it. The sketch filenames are obtained composing the survey name with the name in this field. For example if the survey is "MySurvey" and the sketch is "1", the plan filename is "MySurvey-1p.th2" and the profile filename is "MySurvey-1s.th2". They are placed in the directory "th2" of TopoDroid</li>
<li>the sketch <u>origin</u> station (base station). This is very important as all the sketch data will have coordinates relative to this station. You should choose a station that is inside the sketch to benfit of the <a href="page_sketch_station.htm">midline hiding<a> features.</li>
</ul><br><p>

<b>WARNING. The name of the sketch cannot contain the character '/' (slash), which is the pathname separator.</b><br><p>

So type in the name of the origin station, and tap the <u>OK</u> button.  And you go to the sketch window.<br><p>

Each sketch is made of two Therion 2D sketch files: one for the plan view, the other for the profile view. Of course you can draw cross sections, but we will get to them later. The sketch window opens with the plan view by default.  Afterwards the sketch dialog shows two columns, and you can open a sketch starting either in the plan or in the profile view. In any case TopoDroid always loads the two sketch files. It just displays the chosen view.<br><p>

<b>NOTE</b><br>
The first time you open a sketch TopoDroid loads the drawing tools (the palette). This may take some time if your Android is not powerful because the program has to read in many files (one for each tool). Afterwards opening a sketch is usually faster.<br><p>

You have not drawn anything yet, and the canvas will display a grid (each little square is 1 m, the big squares are 10 m, and the very big ones 100 m), the midline (with both legs and splays), and the stations. These objects are the references to help you drawing the sketch. They are usually very handy however you can choose to hide any of them, if you want to focus on what you have drawn, for editing purposes.<br><p>

The sketch window has four modes:
</ul>
<li><b>move</b>, the default: you can shift the canvas, and zoom in/out. If the "fixed references" box in the references dialog is set, shifts affect only the drawings [level experimental]</li>
<li><b>draw</b>: in this mode you add iconic symbols (points, including labels), and trace lines and areas (closed regions filled with a color). At the basic level drawing is limited to lines.</li>
<li><b>erase</b>: to erase items, and lines/areas, or portions of them, from the sketch.</li>
<li><b>edit</b> [A]: for the fine editing. Shift and zoom are still available, as for the "move" mode.</li>
</ul><br><p>

Sketch shifting is possible even in <b>draw</b> and in <b>erase</b> mode using two fingers. Zoom controls can be enabled (either temporarily or permanently). If temporary, they show up when you tap at the bottom of the canvas in the middle. If "side-dragging" is enabled, the sketch can be shifted by "dragging" it from the left, right and bottom sides of the canvas.<br><p>


<h4>BUTTONS</h4>
The modes are represented by the three green buttons on the left: <u>draw</u>, <u>erase</u>, and <u>edit</u>. When none of them is "on" (has a white frame around) the mode is "move", otherwise it is that of the button that is "on".<br><p>

The remaining buttons differ by the mode. In the <b>move</b> mode they are
<ul>
<li><u>Download</u> downloads data from the DistoX. The latest downloaded shot are bluish to help you distinguish them from the others. If no DistoX is selected, this button is hidden.</li>
<li><u>Bluetooth</u> dialog.</li>
<li><u>Reference</u>: to choose which reference to display: midline, splay shots, stations, and metric grid.</li>
<li><u>Plan/Profile</u> toggles between the sketch of the plan and that of the profile.</li>
<li><u>Extend reference</u>: same as the <u>Extend</u> button of the Survey Data window</li>
<li><u>Notes</u>: to edit the survey annotations</li>
</ul><br><p>

The <b>draw</b> mode has four buttons besides the green ones:
<ul>
<li><u>Undo</u> removes the last items you have drawn, one at a time.</li>
<li><u>Redo</u> puts the removed item back in the sketch, one at a time. The list of removed items is emptied when you draw something new. Pointwise editing actions may also affect the list of redo.</li>
<li><u>Drawing tool</u> picker, to select the drawing tool from the <a href="page_tools.htm">palette</a></li>
<li><u>Continuation</u> [N]. When this button is pressed a line started close to the end of another line of the same type is considered as its continuation and is attached to that. A new line is not created, and the line that has been continued is moved on top of the undo stack.</li> 
</ul><br><p>

The <b>erase</b> mode has the <u>Undo</u> and <u>Redo</u> buttons.<br><p>

The <b>edit</b> [A] mode has, besides the green buttons:
<ul>
<li><u>Previous</u> to go to the previous point in the selection. To do some editing you must select a point (either a point, a line/area point, a station, or a shot midpoint). To do this you tap near the point you want; however if there are several points close by the result is a selection set containing several point, only one of them is the active editing point.  You move among them with the "Previous" and "Next" buttons.</li>
<li><u>Next</u> to go to the next point in the selection.</li>
<li><u>Point</u> (point-wise edit). Editing the item attributes and moving/editing the item point(s).</li>
<li><u>Item</u> (item-wise edit): with this button you edit item properties. For example for a label you can change the text.</li>
<li><u>Delete</u>: deletes the item from the sketch (it asks for confirmation, and can be "undone").</li>
</ul><br><p>

<h4>MENUS</h4>
<ul>
<li><u>Export</u>: the sketch can be exported as <i>Therion</i> 2D file(s), <i>cSurvey</i> (a single file), PNG (two files), DXF (two files), and SVG (two files). See <a href="page_backup.htm">export and backup</a>.</li>
<li><u>Stats</u> displays some statistics (beware that these are limited to the extent of the data reduction of the sketch)</li>
<li><u>Reload</u>: to reload the sketch from the backup copy. See <a href="page_backup.htm">export and backup</a>.</li>
<li><u>Delete</u> marks the sketch as deleted. It can be later recovered as the sketch files are not actually deleted, nor the sketch record is dropped from the database table</li>
<li><u>Palette</u>: to choose the <a href="page_tools.htm">drawing tools</a></li>
<li><u>Overview</u>: opens the overview window which shows all the survey sketches together.</li>
<li><u>Settings</u></li>
<li><u>Help</u></li>

<h4>SKETCH SETTINGS</h4>
<ul>
  <li><i>Drawing tool picker</i>: either most-recent [default], or list view or grid view.</li>
  <li><i>Side drag</i>: whether to enable panning by side-dragging.</li>
  <li><i>Zoom controls</i>: specifies whether and how zoom controls are displayed on multitouch devices [B]. The zoom controls can be hidden, displayed only for a short interval when the user tap the lower part of the screen in the middle, or shown all the time.</li>
  <li><i>Splay plan-view threshold</i>: splay shots with inclination above this threshold are hidden in the plan-view</li>
  <li><i>Splay dash threshold</i>: splay shots with inclination above this threshold are drawn with a dashed line</li>
  <li><i>Cross-section H-threshold</i>: the inclination angle above which a cross-section is horizontal. (Below it cross-section are vertical).</li>
  <li><i>Midline check</i>: whether to check if all the legs are attached to the midline</li>
  <li><i>DRAWING TOOLS >></i>
    <ul style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
    <li><i>Line style</i>. TopoDroid has four line styles. With the normal style [default] the lines are drawn as polylines. With the fine style the polyline segments are shorter, while with the coarse style they are longer. In the fourth style lines are interpolated replacing the segments with cubic Bezier curves. These segments pass through the two endpoints and have two control points used define the curvature.</li>
    <li><i>Line point spacing</i>: this is the distance between line points in the normal style [default 5 pxl] </li>
    <li><i>Bezier accuracy</i> determines the number of base points in the interpolating curve. The smaller the more points. The default value is 1.0.</li>
    <li><i>Bezier corner</i>. Even an interpolated line should have corners, when there is a sharp turn at a point. Small values (0.2) make the corner sharper. Large values (20.0) make them rounded.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i>SKETCH ITEMS >></i>
    <ul style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
    <li><i>Point tools scale</i>: the base scale of point symbols [N]</li>
    <li><i>Line width</i>: the base thickness of drawing lines</li>
    <li><i>Non-zoomed point</i>: whether point items should remain of fixed size when the drawing is zoomed</li>
    <li><i>Survey line width</i>: the base thickness of midline/splay lines</li>
    <li><i>Station name size</i>: size of stations names [default 18 pt] [N]</li>
    <li><i>Labels size</i>: size of label texts [default 24 pt]</li>
    <li><i>Section-line tick size</i>: length of the direction "tick" line in cross-section lines [default 5 pxl]</li>
    <li><i>Green dots radius</i>: size of the green dots displayed in <b>edit</b> mode [default 5 pxl] [N]</li>
    <li><i>Selection radius</i>: the range within which points are selected when fine-editing a sketch; [default 16 pxl]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i>AUTO WALLS [E]</i> settings</li>
</ul>

<b>Warning. If the sketch disappear from the display, switch between plan and profile to force TopoDroid to reload it.</b><br><p>

<hr>
<i>To start drawing select the <b>draw</b> mode (green pencil button) and trace lines with your finger. If you make a mistake you can cancel the whole line with the <u>undo</u> button, or switch to the <u>erase</u> mode.  The drawing is saved in a pair of <i>Therion</i> files when you exit the sketch window. Each cross-section is saved in a single separate Therion file.</i><br><p>
