<h4>Drawing area dialog</h4>

You open the "Drawing area" dialog when you select a point of the border of an area (in editing mode of the "Sketch" window),
and tap the "Edit" button (the "note and pencil").<br><p>

This dialog lets you edit the properties of the area.
At the moment the only property is the visibility of the area border. This has no effect on the way TopoDroid displays the area, but if used by Therion when the survey map is generated.
