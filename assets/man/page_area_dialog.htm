<h4>Drawing area</h4>

This dialog is opened when you select a point of the border of an area (in editing mode of the <i>Sketch</i> window),
and tap the <i>Edit</i> button.<br><p>

You can change the type of area, by selecting it from the scroll down list.<br><p>

Area properties:
<ul>
<li><b>visibility</b> of the area border</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

The area border visibility is written in the Therion export, so that it can be used when the survey map is generated.<br>
TopoDroid displays the area shaded region without a border if the visibility is off. Otherwise a light grey border is shown.<br>
The default value of the area border visibility is a setting.<br><p>

<b>Point decimation</b><br>
The nunmber of border points can be reduced, either 
keeping one point every two (single check), or one every four (double check).<br>

Finally you can change the layers to area belongs to.
The area is not displayed if all its layers are OFF.
The border points will nevertheless be shown in edit mode, so that the area edit dialog remains accessible.
