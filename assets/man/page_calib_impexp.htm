<h4>Calibration export</h4>

The calibration CSV export contains the calibration details (name, date, device BT address, comment, algorithm), followed by the calibration data. Each data line contains: the data index, the G and M values (six integers), the data group, the azimuth, clino and roll of the data, the error, and the status.<br><p>

<h4>Calibration import</h4>

To import a calibration that has been exported to a csv file, tap the button <u>Import</u> of the Calibrations dialog. This opens a dialog listing the files in the "csv" subdirectory. Select the one you want to import or press the Android "BACK" hw button to cancel.<br><p>

A calibration import fails if the calibration name is already present in the database, or if thei DistoX device of the calibration is not the current device.<br><p>
