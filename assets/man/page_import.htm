<h4>Survey import</h4>

This dialog is opened tapping the <u>Import</u> button in the main window.<br><p>

It displays the list of files that can be imported in the app.<br><p>

TopoDroid can import the survey files in the following formats:
<ul>
<li><i>Therion</i>: ".th" data files, with simple data format ("normal from to length compass clino" and optionally LRUD).
Therion scrap are not imported.</li>
<li><i>Compass</i> ".dat" files (not fully tested)</li>
<li><i>Survex</i> ".svx" files with "normal" non-interleaved data format (not fully tested)</li>
<li><i>VisualTopo</i> ".tro" files (not fully tested)</li>
<li><i>PocketTopo</i> ".top" files. Data and drawings are imported (not fully tested)</li>
<li><i>CaveSniper</i> ".csn" text files (untested).</li>
<li>TopoDroid ZIP archives. These are special zip files with the information to repopulate the database, the drawings (".tdr" files), the annotation file, and the media files (photo/audio).</li>
</ul><br>

Zip archives are searched in the "zip" directory (that is where TopoDroid saves them). Survey files are searched in the "import" directory. Therefore you must copy the survey file you want to import in this directory. If the survey name of the file to import already exists in the database the file is not imported.<br><p>

<b>Therion import</b><br>
Only Therion survey files with data in "normal" datamode are importable.<br>
TopoDroid does not import Therion scraps.<br><p>

<b>PocketTopo import</b><br>
TopoDroid imports both the survey data and the sketches.
This import maps PocketTopo colors to TopoDroid drawing tools (points and lines).
The mapping can be modified through a setting.<br><p>

<b>Compass import</b><br>
TopoDroid converts imported compass survey from "normal" datamode to "diving" datamode [T],if the reletive setting is enabled [G].<br><p>

<b>N.B.</b>
Import may fail (and crash the app) due to failure on the database that TopoDroid cannot intercept.
If this happens delete the partially imported survey and retry to import it.<br><p>
