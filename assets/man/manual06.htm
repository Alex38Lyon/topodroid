<h3>[6] CALIBRATION WINDOW</h3>

Tapping the <u>Calibration</u> menu in the Device activity window takes to the Calibrations dialog, which lists the calibrations of the selected DistoX.<br><p>

To import a calibration that has been exported to a csv file, tap the button <u>Import</u>. This opens a dialog listing the files in the "csv" subdirectory. Select the one you want to import or press the Android "BACK" hw button to cancel. A calibration import fails if the calibration name is already present in the database, or if the calibration device is not the current device.<br><p>

To create a new calibration tap on the <u>New Calibration</u> button in the dialog. This brings you to the window for the calibration informations. The "date" field is prefilled with the current date. The "device" field is prefilled with the address of the DistoX, and cannot be modified. You must give a "name" to the calibration. The name is what appears in the list of calibrations. You can optionally enter a brief "description". By default TopoDroid will pick automatically the calibration algorithm based on the DistoX model and firmware. However you can force it to use either the linear or the non-linear algorithm. When you are done tap the <u>Save</u> button (the leftmost) to save the calibration info to the database.<br><p>

<b>WARNING. The name of the calibration must not contain the character '/' (slash), which is the pathname separator.</b><br><p>

When you open an existing calibration (tapping the calibration name in the list of the calibration of a DistoX), you get the same interface.  The only difference is that the name of the calibration is no more editable.<br><p>

<h4>MENUS</h4>
<ul>
<li><u>Export</u> The calibration data can be exported as a CSV text file that can be imported in a spreadsheet program</li>
<li><u>Delete</u> removes the calibration informations and its data from the database. This is a non-recoverable action.</li>
<li><u>Settings</u></li>
<li><u>Help</u></li>
</ul><br><p>

The calibration CSV export contains the calibration details (name, date, device BT address, comment, algorithm), followed by the calibration data. Each data line contains: the data index, the G and M values (six integers), the data group, the azimuth, clino and roll of the data, the error, and the status.<br><p>

<h4>BUTTONS</h4>
<ul>
<li><u>Save</u> saves the calibration informations to the database</li>
<li><u>Open</u> opens the calibration data window</li>
<li><u>Read</u> [A] displays the calibration coefficients. This shows the values of the calibration coefficients previouly computed, and stored in the database</li>
</ul><br><p>


<h4>CALIBRATION SETTINGS</h4>
<ul>
<li><i>Group policy</i>: how to split the calibration data into groups. The three policies are described in the section about calibration data</li>
<li><i>Group tolerance</i>: the maximum angular distance between consecutive data for them to be in the same group when the "distance-based" group-policy is used</li>
<li><i>Error</i>: the computation of the coefficients terminates when the variation of any calibration coefficient during an iteration step is smaller than this value. A reasonable value is 10<sup>-6</sup>.</li>
<li><i>Iterations</i>: the maximum number of iteration for the calibration algorithm</li>
<li><i>Raw data</i>: whether to display the raw data. By default TopoDroid displays the azimuth, inclination, and roll. Check this option if you want to see also the raw calibration data</li>
<li><i>Algorithm</i>: can be 0 (auto), 1 (linear), 2 (non-linear). If a calibration algorithm is left "auto", and this setting is not "auto", then the algorithm of the settings is used to calculate the calibration. If they are both "auto" the algorithm is chosen automatically by TopoDroid depending on the DistoX model and firmware.</li>
</ul><br><p>

<i>Now fill the necessary fields, save the calibration info to the database, and open it.
You are in the calibration data window, ready to take the calibration shots.</i><br><p>
