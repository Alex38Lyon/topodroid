<h4>Survey Annotations dialog</h4>

The "Survey annotations" dialog is opened 
with the "Notes" button ("note with pencil" icon) of the "Shot list" window, 
the "Survey info" window, and the "Sketch" window (in "moving" mode).
<br><p>

With this dialog you can write and edit a generic text with notes that integrates the data and the drawing
of your survey.<br><p>

<ul>
<li><b>Save</b>: save the changes and close the dialog</li>
<li>"Back" key: close the dialog without saving the changes</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

The notes are saved in a text file in the "txt" subdirectory of "TopoDroid".<br>
You can also edit this file with other text editors.
