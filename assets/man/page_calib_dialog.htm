<h4>Calibrations dialog</h4>

Tapping the "Calibration" button (the gear) of the Device window opens the Calibrations dialog.<br><p>

This dialog has two buttons to
<ul>
<li>create a new calibration</li>
<li>import a calibration from the CSV export</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

Underneath there is the list of the calibrations of the current device.

<h4>Open an existing calibration</h4>

Tap the calibration entry in the list to open it in the Calibration window.<br><p>

<h4>Creating a new calibration</h4>

Tapping the "New" button opens the "Calibration" window, where you can enter the data for the new calibration, and create it.
After it is saved to the database you can open it (in the the "Calibration data" window), download the calibration data, compute the calibration coefficients and upload them to the DistoX.<br><p>


<h4>Calibration import</h4>

To import a calibration that has been exported to a csv file, tap the button <u>Import</u> of the Calibrations dialog. This opens a dialog listing the files in the "csv" subdirectory. Select the one you want to import or press the Android "BACK" hw button to cancel.<br><p>

A calibration import fails if the calibration name is already present in the database, or if thei DistoX device of the calibration is not the current device.<br><p>
