<b>TopoDroid camera</b><br>
This is a simple implementation of a camera. 
Its unique feature is that it stores the azimuth and inclination of the device in exif tags in the image file. 
The azimuth is stored as GPS_LONGITUDE and the inclination as GPS_LATITUDE (with sign).
<br>
The date/time is also stored in the exif tags.
<br><p>

The camera has two or three buttons on the lower right.<br>
When the <b>camera</b> button is red you can take a picture. When it is blue, the camera is on hold: tap it to
turn it active.<br>
The <b>save</b> button appears after you have taken a picture.<br>
The last one is the <b>back</b> button.<br><p>
