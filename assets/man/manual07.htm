<h3>[7] SHOT LIST</h3>

The shots are shown in a list. The list has no header to save space.  The shot informations are
<ul>
<li>Index (optional: it is shown only if the related choice in the <u>Display mode</u> dialog is checked)</li>
<li>From station</li>
<li>To station</li>
<li>Distance</li>
<li>Azimuth</li>
<li>Inclination</li>
<li>Extend direction: either left (&lt;), right (&gt;), vertical (|), or ignore (-)</li>
</ul>
Additional characters denote the presence of a comment (N), a photo (P), and a flag: either duplicate shot (*) or a surface shot (-).<br><p>

Blank shots, and repeated-legs can be hidden. Splay shots can also be hidden to unclutter the list of shots. However, even if splays are not shown, you can see those at a station by tapping on the station name in a leg shot. To hide them tap again on the station name (even a tap on the name in a splay will do).<br><p>

Topodroid can set the station names automatically according to a <a href="page_station_policy.htm">station assignment policy</a>.<br><p>

<b>Shot item tappings</b>
<ul>
<li>a short tap on a station toggles the display of splays at that station</li>
<li>a long tap on a station makes that station the <a href="page_current.htm">current</a> one (it is highlighted green)</li>
<li>a tap on the distance or the azimuth open the <a href="page_shot_edit1.htm">first shot edit</a> dialog, with which you can set the stations as well as other attributes of the shot.</li>
<li>a tp on the clino opens the <a href="page_shot_edit2.htm">second shot edit</a> dialog.</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

If you use TopoDroid automatic <a href="page_station_policy.htm">station naming</a>, you are likely to need the shot dialog only to enter the comment, and to change the "extend" direction. These two actions can be done also from the drawing window, by selecting the shot in "edit" mode [A] and picking the <u>Note</u> button: this is described in the section on the <u>Sketch</u> window).<br><p>
