<h3>[7] SHOT LIST</h3>

The shots are shown in a list. The list has no header to save space.  The shot informations are
<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li>Index (optional: it is shown only if the related choice in the <u>Display mode</u> dialog is checked)</li>
<li>From station</li>
<li>To station</li>
<li>Distance</li>
<li>Azimuth</li>
<li>Inclination</li>
<li>Extend direction: either left (&lt;), right (&gt;), vertical (|), or ignore (-)</li>
</ul>
Additional characters denote the presence of a comment (N), a photo (P), and a flag: either duplicate shot (*) or a surface shot (-).<br><p>

Blank shots, and repeated-legs can be hidden. Splay shots can also be hidden to unclutter the list of shots. However, even if splays are not shown, you can see those at a station by tapping on the station name in a leg shot. To hide them tap again on the station name (even a tap on the name in a splay will do).<br><p>

Topodroid can set the station names automatically according to the <a href="page_station_policy.htm">station assignment policy</a>.<br><p>

<b>Shot item tappings</b>
<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li>a short tap on a station name toggles the display of splays at that station (only if splays are globally hidden)</li>
<li>a long tap on a station name makes it the <a href="page_current.htm">active</a> station (it is highlighted green)</li>
<li>a short tap on distance or azimuth opens the <a href="page_shot_edit1.htm">first shot edit</a> dialog, in which you can set the stations as well as other attributes of the shot.</li>
<li>a long tap on distance or azimuth of a shot opens the last used sketch and center it at the relevant station. If a splay was tapped, it is highlighted red</li>
<li>a tap on the clino or the extend opens the <a href="page_shot_edit2.htm">second shot edit</a> dialog.</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

If you use TopoDroid automatic <a href="page_station_policy.htm">station naming</a>, you are likely to need the shot dialog only to enter the comment, and to change the "extend" direction. These two actions can be done also from the drawing window, by selecting the shot in "edit" mode [A] and picking the <u>Note</u> button: this is described in the section on the <u>Sketch</u> window).<br><p>
