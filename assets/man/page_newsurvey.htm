<h4>New survey dialog</h4>
At first the list of surveys in the mani window is empty. To add a new survey tap on the <u>Add</u> button (the "plus" sign). You get a dialog to specify the survey information.<br><p>

The survey name is mandatory. It must be unique in the database. The survey names are used to list surveys in the main window and TopoDroid distinguishes surveys by their name (although each survey has a unique numerical id in the database).<br>
<b>The name of the survey cannot contain the character '/' (slash), which is the pathname separator.</b><br><p>

The date is written with format "yyyy.mm.dd". For example January 6, 2015 is "2015.01.06". It is preset to the current date.<br><p>

Team and description are empty (unless you have set a default team in the app settings). They can safely be left so, although it is a good practice to take the time to fill them.<br><p>

The magnetic declination is 0.0 by default. If you know it you can enter it here, otherwise you can look it up in the web after you have found the coordinates of a fixed point (say, the cave entrance) with the GPS [A].<br><p>

Save when you are done, and the new survey name will appear in the list of surveys of the mani window.<br><p>
