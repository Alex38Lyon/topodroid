<h4>Sensor dialog</h4>

The "Sensor" dialog is opened by tapping a sensor measurement entry in the "Sensor list" window.<br><p>

This dialog displays some info about the measurement (title, type, shot, and value) and a form
to change the sensor <b>comment</b>.<br><p>

<ul>
<li><b>OK</b> saves the changes and closes the dialog</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> deletes the measurement</li>
</ul>

<b>Delete</b> does not remove the sensor measurement from the database, but marks it as "deleted".
It can be recovered with a <i>SQLite</i> app.<br><p>
