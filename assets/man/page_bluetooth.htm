<h4>Bluetooth dialog</h4>

The Bluetooth dialog has the following actions:
<ul>
<li>turn on/off the laser</li>
<li>take a measurement and download it</li>
<li>reset the BT connection</li>
</ul>

If you experience problems with the DistoX after downloading some data, you may try to reset the bluetooth connection on TopoDroid, switch the DistoX on and off, and retry downloading the data.<br><p>
