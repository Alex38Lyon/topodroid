<h4>Bluetooth</h4>

The <u>Bluetooth</u> button is present in the shot data window, in the sketc window, and in the calibration data window.<br><p>

For the DistoX A3 the <u>Bluetooth</u> button resets the Bluetooth connection.<br><p>

For the DistoX X310 it open a drop-down menu [experimental level only]:
<ul>
<li><b>Reset</b> the BT connection</li>
<li>turn on/off the laser</li>
<li>take a shot or a calibration data</li>
<li>take three shots in a row, ie, a leg (data or sketch window))</li>
</ul>

In the data and sketch windows, the shots are downloaded immediately if the device communication mode is "continuous".<br>
In the calibration data window, the data is downloaded immediately depending on a setting.<br><p>

After turning on the laser there is a short pause before taking a shot. Similarly there is a pause between shots when three are taken. The lengths of these pauses are defined in settings.<br><p>
