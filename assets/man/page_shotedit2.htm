<h4>Shot edit dialog (2)</h4>

The secondary "Shot edit" dialog is opened by long-tapping the shot entry in the "Shot list" window.<br><p>

This dialog shows the shot stations and data (length, azimuth, inclination).<br><p>

At an activity level "Basic" or "Normal" this dialog has only a button to <b>Delete</b> the shot.<br><p>

At higher activity levels it has five buttons:
<ul>
<li><b>Photo</b>: "New Photo" dialog.</li>
<li><b>Sensor</b>: "New Measurement" dialog.</li>
<li><b>Add</b> a shot after this (manually entering the data).</li>
<li><b>Split</b> the survey at this shot.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> the shot.</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

The <b>delete</b> button does not remove the shot from the database.
The shot gets marked as "deleted" and can be later recovered with the "Recovery" dialog.<br><p>
