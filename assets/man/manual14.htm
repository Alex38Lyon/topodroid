<h3>[14] OVERVIEW WINDOW</h3>

You get into tthe Overview window from the "OVERVIEW" menu of the Drawing window.
<br>
The Overview window displays all the sketches together, either in plan or in profile view depending on the view of the Drawing window.
The Overview window has only one button, namely the measure-mode button, and
it can be either in normal mode (canvas shift an dzoom), or in measure-mode.

<b>Measure-mode</b><br>
When the Overview window is in measure-mode you can measure the distance between two points on the canvas.
To do this you tap first on the first point: this is displayed as a pink circled cross. Next you tap on the
second point: this is shown with a blue cross and the 2D distance is shown in the title bar, together with the differences alon the X and Y axes. 
Any further tap changes the second point (and the distance).<br>
To reset the first point tap on the "measure-mode" button.<br>
The distance is computed
in the plane of the canvas. In plan view, this is the horizontal distance. In profile view the Y-axis difference is the difference in elevation.
