<h4>Drawing tools palette</h4>

The default drawing tools include several points [N], lines, and areas [N]. It is likely you do not need many of them, and removing the unnecessary tools from the palette makes picking the tool you want to use easier. The <u>palette</u> menu comes for this purpose. It shows the list of the drawing tools with checkboxes that denote the enabled tools. You switch on and off the tools to your need then close the dialog (with the <u>back</u> button) to save the changes. You have to do this independently for points, lines and areas.<br><p>

Each sketch carries its own palette.  When you close the sketch it is saved with a header listing the enabled tools. When you reopen it, the palette is set to the sketch palette. If the sketch contains items which are not in the palette they are added. If a item is not among the drawing tools it is replaced with the "user" tool. The "user" tools (point, line and area) are always in the palette.<br><p>
