<h3>[1] INTRODUCTION</h3>

<h4>Activity levels</h4>
The TopoDroid interface has activity levels, differing by the number of actions that are enabled.
<ul>
<li>At the <b>basic</b> level [B] drawing is limited to lines, with no editing actions.</li>
<li>The <b>normal</b> level [N] contains all the functions for a detailed cave survey.</li>
<li>The <b>advanced</b> level [A] has all the functions.</li>
<li>The <b>experimental</b> level [E] is only for development. It has also the experimental features enabled. These features are partly debugged and may easily crash the app. Please report any problem with them.</li>
</ul><br>
By default TopoDroid has only the <b>normal</b> functions enabled, but you can switch level, according to your needs, without exiting from the program. This manual describes the complete TopoDroid. Features at a level above "basic" are marked with the level initial, [N], [A], or [E].<br><p>

<h4>Windows</h4>
TopoDroid has a main window from which you can move to other app activities.  The main activities are:
<ul>
<li><b>Survey</b> data management (survey and shot-list windows).</li>
<li><b>Sketch</b> drafting (drawing window) is a sub-activity of the Survey activity.</li>
<li><b>DistoX</b> functions (device window)</li>
<li><b>Calibration</b> of DistoX (calibration and calibration-data windows) is a sub-activity of the Device activity.</li>
</ul><br>

Topodroid windows have a scrollable button bar at the top, for the most frequent actions, and a menu button at the top-right.
The dialogs usually have a confirmation button (<i>OK</i> or <i>Save</i>). If you want to close the dialog, or cancel whatever you have done, tap the Android <i>BACK</i> button. If there are both the <i>OK</i> and the <i>Save</i> button, the former saves the input data and closes the dialog, while the latter saves the input data and keep the dialog open for a new input. 
Information dialogs have no buttons.<br><p>

In every TopoDroid window the hardware MENU key opens the <u>Help</u> pages.<br><p>

<h4>Text and Buttons size</h4>
The "Text Size" setting specifies the dimension of the list text entries, in particular the list of surveys, that of shots, and that of calibration data.<br>
There are two choices for the size of buttons: "small" and "large". The first is suitable for cell phones (5' screen), and is the default. The second is suitable for tablets (7' screen).<br><p>

<h4>Drawing tools (palette)</h4>
TopoDroid comes with a considerable number of drawing tools bundled in.
By default only the most basic tools are enabled. 
You can enable more tools as the need arises, with the menu "palette".
By this means you can get used to the TopoDroid "iconography" a bit at a time.
