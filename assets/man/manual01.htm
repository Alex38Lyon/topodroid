<h3>[1] INTRODUCTION</h3>

TopoDroid has a main window from which you can move to other app activities.  The main activities are:
<ul>
<li><b>Survey</b> data management (survey and shot-list windows).</li>
<li><b>Sketch</b> drafting (drawing window) is a sub-activity of the Survey activity.</li>
<li><b>DistoX</b> functions (device window)</li>
<li><b>Calibration</b> of DistoX (calibration and calibration-data windows) is a sub-activity of the Device activity.</li>
</ul><br>

Topodroid windows have a scrollable button bar at the top, for the most frequent actions, and a menu button at the top-right.
The dialogs usually have a confirmation button (<i>OK</i> or <i>Save</i>). If you want to close the dialog, or cancel whatever you have done, tap the Android <i>BACK</i> button. If there are both the <i>OK</i> and the <i>Save</i> button, the former saves the input data and closes the dialog, while the latter saves the input data and keep the dialog open for a new input. 
Information dialogs have no buttons.<br><p>

In every TopoDroid window the hardware MENU key opens the <u>Settings</u> dialog.<br><p>

<h4>Text and Buttons size</h4>
The "Text Size" setting specifies the dimention of the list text entries, in particular the list of surveys, that of shots, and that of calibration data.<br>
There are two choices for the size of buttons: "small" and "large". The first is suitable for cellphones (5' screen), and is the default. The second is suitable for tablets (7' screen).<br><p>
