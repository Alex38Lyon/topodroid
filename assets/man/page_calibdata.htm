<h4>Calibration data dialog</h4>
Tapping on a calibration item in the listi of calibration data opens the calibration data dialog.<br><p>

Through this dialog the item group can be set or changed: use a positive integer for data that take part to the computation of the calibration coefficients, 0 (zero) for data that do not contribute to the computation, and -1 (negative one) for "deleted" data. Deleted data are not usually shown in the calibration data list and are not taken into account in the automatic group assignment.<br><p>

The dialog has three buttons:
<ul>
<li>if the <i>Regroup</i> button is checked, when you save your changes, TopoDroid recomputes the items groups starting at that item, using the current group policy.</li>
<li>the <i>Save</i> button saves the group number and closes the dialog.</li>
<li>the <i>Delete</i> button "deletes" the item and closes the dialog. Deleted item, by default, they are not listed in the display. You can toggle their display with the <u>Display</u> menu. Deleted items are shown with a grey background. If you tap on a deleted item you get a dialog to undelete the item.</li>
</ul><br><p>
