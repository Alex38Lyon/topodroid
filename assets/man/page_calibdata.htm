<h4>Calibration data</h4>

This dialog is opened tapping on a data item in the <i>Calibration data</i> window.<br><p>

Through this dialog the item group can be set or changed: use a positive integer for data that take part to the computation of the calibration coefficients, 0 (zero) for data that do not contribute to the computation, and -1 (negative one) for "deleted" data. Deleted data are not usually shown in the calibration data list and are not taken into account in the automatic group assignment.<br><p>

The dialog has three buttons:
<ul>
<li><b>Regroup</b>: if checked, when you save your changes, TopoDroid recomputes the items groups starting at that item, using the current group policy.</li>
<li><b>Save</b> the group number and closes the dialog.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> the item</li>
</ul><br><p>

Deleted item are not dropped from the database. By default, they are not listed in the display. You can toggle their display with the <u>Display</u> menu. Deleted items are shown with a grey background. If you tap on a deleted item you get a dialog to undelete the item.<br><p>
