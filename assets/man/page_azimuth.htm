<h4>Extend Reference dialog</h4>

The "Extend reference" dialog is opened by tapping the "azimuth" button either in the "Shot list" window
or in the "Sketch" window.<br><p>

The "Extend reference" is used to assign the profile "extend" direction to the midline legs.<br><p>

The "azimuth" button displays either a long arrow inside a circle, oriented to the 
current extend reference direction, or a short arrow directed left or right (for fixed "extend").<br>
When the profile "extend" is compute using the "extend reference" it is set to right if it differs from the
reference by less than 90 degrees. Otherwise it is set to left.
<br><p>

The "Extend reference" dialog has
<ul>
<li>a button displaying the current selection of "extend reference"</li>
<li>a slider to change the value of the "extend reference", between -180 and 180 degrees</li>
<li>a "compass" button to use the Android magnetic sensors to get the "extend reference" azimuth</li>
<li>the <b>left</b> button to fix the "extend" to the left (-1)</li>
<li>the <b>right</b> button to fix the "extend" to the right (+1)</li>
<li>the <b>ok</b> button to save the "extend reference" azimuth</li>
</ul>
