<h4>Extend Reference</h4>

This dialog is opened tapping the <u>azimut</u> button either in the <i>Shot list</i> window
or in the <i>Sketch</i> window.<br><p>

The extend reference is used to assign the profile "extend" direction to the midline legs.<br><p>

The <u>azimut</u> button displays either a long arrow inside a circle, oriented to the 
current extend reference direction, or a short arrow directed left or right (for fixed "extend").<br>
When the profile "extend" is compute using the "extend reference" it is set to right if it differs from the
reference by less than 90 degrees. Otherwise it is set to left.
<br><p>

This dialog has
<ul>
<li>"extend reference" <b>azimut</b></li>
<li>slider to change its value between -180 and 180 degrees</li>
<li><b>compass</b> sets the value using the Android magnetic sensors</li>
<li><b>left</b> forces "extend" to LEFT (-1)</li>
<li><b>right</b> forces "extend" to RIGHT (+1)</li>
<li><b>ok</b>: use the azimuth for the "extend"</li>
</ul>
