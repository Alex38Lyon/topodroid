TopoDroid comes with one default set of drawing tools, and other eight sets [T]:
<table cellpadding="2">
<tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>Points</th><th>Lines</th><th>Areas</th></tr>
<tr><td>speleology</td>    <td>45</td><td>16</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td>speleology (2)</td><td>42</td><td>23</td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>archeology</td>    <td>35</td><td> 0</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>artifacts</td>     <td>14</td><td> 7</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>geology</td>       <td>35</td><td> 5</td><td>17</td></tr>
<tr><td>biology</td>       <td>14</td><td> 0</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>paleonthology</td> <td>28</td><td> 0</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>mining</td>        <td> 2</td><td> 4</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>karst</td>         <td>14</td><td> 8</td><td>2</td></tr>
</table><br><p>

The drawing tools are distinguighed by the <i>name</i> and the <i>type</i> (point, line, or area).<br>
A few tools are invluded in more than one set.
<br><p>

By default only the speleology tools are installed.
The installation of additional tools is disabled by a setting [G].
<br><p>

Current symbols are stored in the subfolders of <i>TopoDroid/symbol</i>.
Installed symbols can be edited and modified, or even deleted. Forthermore, if other custom symbols
are placed in the proper subfolder, TopoDroid will load and use them.
The additional symbol sets are provided mostly as examples of custom symbols.
<br>
Eight symbols cannot be removed, namely the three "user" symbols, points "label" and "section", lines "wall" and "section",
and area "water".
These symbols are not stored as files, and cannot be overridden.
Custom symbols with the same name as these symbol are skipped.
<br><p>

With the <i>PALETTE</i> menu [G] of the <u>main window</u> you get a dialog listing the sets of tools.
Check the tool sets you want to add and press the button <i>Install</i>.
<br>
If you press the button <i>Replace</i> the currently installed tools are removed before
installing the tool sets you selected.
<br>
<p>

After installing you must enable the tools you need, using the <i>Palette</i> button
of the <u>main window</u>. The choice of enabled tools is stored in the database and is not lost when 
tools are removed, therefore you will find them enabled if you re-install the set later.
