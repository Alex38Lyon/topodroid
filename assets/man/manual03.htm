<h3>[3] DEVICE WINDOW</h3>

Before surveying you need to connect and pair the DistoX with the Android and calibrate it. Tap the <u>DistoX</u> button from the Main windows to open the Device window. The list of known DistoX devices is shown in the middle. TopoDroid works with one DistoX at a time. To select it tap on its entry in the list. The name of the selected DistoX is shown at the top, just below the buttons. If no DistoX is selected, there is a red message saying "Device not selected".<br><p>

If the DistoX list is empty, your DistoX ineed to be connected and paired with the Android. This can be done with TopoDroid (<u>Scan</u> and <u>Pair</u> menus) or with the <i>Settings</i> app.<br><p>

<b>DistoX nickname</b><br>
By default TopoDroid uses the BT address as name for a DistoX. The DistoXes can be given nicknames to distinguish among several devices more easily.<br><p>

<h4>ACTIONS</h4>
<ul>
<li>tap on a DistoX makes it the current DistoX</li>
<li>long tap on a DistoX sets the <a href="page_devicename.htm">nickname</a></li>

<li><u>Read</u> [A] and display the calibration coefficients from the DistoX.</li>
