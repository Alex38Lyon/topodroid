<h3>[3] DEVICE WINDOW</h3>

Before surveying you need to connect and pair the DistoX with the Android and calibrate it. Tap the <u>DistoX</u> button from the Main windows to open the Device window. The list of known DistoX devices s shown in the middle. TopoDroid works with one DistoX at a time. To select it tap on its entry in the list. The name of the selected DistoX is shown at the top, just below the buttons. If no DistoX is selected, there is a red message saying "Device not selected".<br><p>

If the DistoX list is empty, your DistoX ineed to be connected and paired with the Android. This can be done with TopoDroid (<u>Scan</u> and <u>Pair</u> menus) or with the <i>Settings</i> app.<br><p>

<b>DistoX nickname</b><br>
By default TopoDroid uses the BT address as name for a DistoX. However you can assign a nickname to the DistoX to make it easier to distinguish among devices if you work with several of them. Long tap on a device to enter its nickname.<br><p>

<h4>ACTIONS</h4>
<ul>
<li>tap on a DistoX makes it the current DistoX</li>
<li>long tap on a DistoX sets the nickname</li>
</ul><br><p>

<h4>BUTTONS</h4>
You need the DistoX turned on for button actions, except for the first and third buttons.
<ul>
<li><u>Bluetooth</u> connection reset. No connection with the DistoX is established.</li>
<li><u>Mode-toggle</u> toggles the DistoX calibration mode on and off</li>
<li><u>Calibrations</u> of the current device.</li>
<li><u>Memory</u> [A] <a href="page_memory.htm">DistoX memory</a> functions</li>
<li><u>Read</u> [A] reads and displays the calibration coefficients stored in the DistoX.</li>
<li><u>Info</u> [A] reads some DistoX information (hw/fw, etc.). This dialog has also two checkboxes through which you can force the DistoX model to TopoDroid: select the model and press the "save" button. Beware that if you set the wrong model some device function might not work</li>
</ul><br><p>

<b>Calibrations dialog</b><br>
The Calibrations dialog displays the list of calibrations of the current device, that are recorded in the database. If no calibration is found the list is empty. A new calibration is added with the "New Calibration" button. The dialog has also a button to import a calibration from the exported csv file.</li>

<h4>MENUS</h4>
<ul>
<li><u>Scan</u> searches for new DistoX devices. The DistoX must be on. You might have to try two or three times before the DistoX is found.</li>
<li><u>Pair</u>: pairs the current DistoX device with the Android, if not already paired</li>
<li><u>Disconnect</u> detaches the current device. The pairing between Android and the DistoX is not broken</li>
<li><u>Firmware</u> [A]: used to dump and upload <a hre="page_firmware.htm">firmwares</a> to the DistoX2</li>
<li><u>Settings</u>: device activity settings</li>
<li><u>Help</u></li>
</ul><br>

<h4>DEVICE SETTINGS</h4>
<ul>
<li><i>Bluetooth</i>: whether to enable, disable, or check on start-up [default]</li>
<li><i>Data connection</i>: either stay connected to the DistoX to <a href="page_download.htm">download shot data</a> as soon as they are taken, or download the shots in burst, "on-demand" [default]. This applies only to data: other DistoX functions use a one-shot query mode</li>
<li><i>Auto reconnect</i>: automatically reconnect if the connection is lost in "continuous" data download-mode</li>
<li><i>Socket</i> type: either normal [default] or "insecure"</li>
<li><i>Z6-workaround</i> Fixes a download timeout error on a Z6 phone, and possibly other devices. It is safe to leave this enabled</li>
<li><i>Connection delay</i>: delay [1/10 sec] before trying to connect to the DistoX [default 0, no delay]</li>
<li><i>Auto pairing</i>: whether TopoDroid should try to pair with the DistoX selected from a scan</li>
