<h4>Location</h4>

To locate a station (GPS button), you must first specify the station name. Next enter the coordinate manually ("Add" button), or get them with the Android GPS ("GPS" button). While searching for satellites the button displays the number of satellites in sight. You should wait till this number becomes green and the coordinates are displayed underneath. Then stop the GPS tapping the button again, and tap the "Add" button.<br><p>

Internally TopoDroid stores the coordinates in decimal degrees. However, in the coordinates dialog, you can write latitude and longitude either in the format "dd:mm:ss.ss" or as decimal degrees. If your keyboard does not show the semicolon ':' use the space instead. If your keyboard does not have the decimal point '.' use the slash '/' instead.<br>
Tapping the "E" and "N" buttons changes the East/West and North/South hemisphere for the coordinates. Effectively it is like entering negative coordinates.<br>
The altitude is stored in meters and it is always the WGS84 altitude.<br><p>

The coordinates of all fixed points are listed in the dialog, as "station longitude latitude altitude". Tapping any of them opens another dialog where you can get the magnetic declination at the point (through internet), convert the coordinates to another coordinate reference system (using <i>Proj4</i>), get the orthometric altitude (need internet to lookup the correction), change the station name, or delete the fixed point.<br><p>
