<h4>Calibration validation</h4>

A calibration can be validated against another calibration of the same DistoX.<br><p>

With the <u>Validation</u> menu you get the list of the other calibrations of that DistoX,
and you choose which one to validate with, by tapping its entry.<br><p>

The validation result dialog displays
<ul>
<li>the "accuracy" of the first calibration on the data of the second one. For each group of data
the direction of the average of the group data is computed, as well as those of individual data.
The accuracy is reported as average and std deviation of the angular difference between the directions
of individual data and that of the average</li>
<li>the "accuracy" of the second calibration on the data of the first one</li>
<li>the "precision" of the calibrations, measured as average, std deviation and maximum of the angular
differences between the direction computed with the first calibration and that computed with the second one.</li>
</ul>
