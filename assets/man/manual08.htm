<h4>Export dialog</h4>
The export dialog has a selection-list of export-formats: <i>Compass</i>, <i>cSurvey</i>, <i>Survex</i>, <i>PocketTopo</i>, <i>Polygon</i>, <i>Therion</i>, <i>VisualTopo</i>, and <i>Walls</i>. Furthermore the data can be exported as DXF, and CSV text file. If the survey has a fixed station it can be exported as KML, and track file (PLT). This export fails if no the survey station is fixed. Finally you can export a ZIP archive with all the data of the survey.<br><p>

There are a number of export settings, that control the way TopoDroid writes the survey data in the various export formats.<br><p>

<h4>Delete dialog</h4>
The delete dialog ask for confirmation to delete the survey. Deleting the survey is unrecoverable: the survey and all associated data (photos, notes, sketch files, etc. ) except the zip archive. Make sure to export a backup ZIP archive before you delete the survey.<br><p>
