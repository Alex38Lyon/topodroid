<h3>[8] SURVEY INFO WINDOW</h3>

Before we get to take measurements let's look at the survey informations dialog. You open it by long tapping on the survey entry in the main window, or with the appropriate menu of the shot window.<br><p>

<h4>BUTTONS</h4>
<ul>
<li><u>Notes</u>: to edit the survey annotations. Use the annotation to write down anything that can be useful later.  You can edit the global survey annotations also from the shot window and from the sketch window</li>
<li><u>Stats</u> displays some statistics: the number of (regular) legs and their total length, the number of duplicate legs, and that of surface leg. The number of splay shots, that of stations, the number of loops and the number of disconnected surveys (this is 1 if the legs are all attached together in one survey)</li>
<li><u>3D</u>: the 3D display. This is the same as the <u>3D</u> menu of the shot-list activity</li>
<li><u>GPS</u> [A]: to enter (or get with the GPS) the coordinates of a fixed station, eg, the entrance. The fixed points coordinates that have already been defined, are listed.</li>
<li><u>Photos</u> [A] lists the pictures of the survey. Tapping one of them you get a dialog to edit the description or delete the photo</li>
<li><u>Sensors</u> [A]: shows the list of sensor measurements of the survey. At the moment these are not editable.</li>
</ul><br><p>

<h4>MENUS</h4>
<ul>
<li><u>Export</u>: export dialog</li>
<li><u>Delete</u> delete dialog</li>
<li><u>Calibration</u> <a href="page_instruments.htm">instruments calibration</a> dialog</li>
<li><u>Settings</u> (same as the shot window settings)</li>
<li><u>Help</u></li>
</ul><br><p>

<h4>Export dialog</h4>
The export dialog has a selection-list of export-formats: <i>Compass</i>, <i>cSurvey</i>, <i>Survex</i>, <i>PocketTopo</i>, <i>Therion</i>, <i>VisualTopo</i>, and <i>Walls</i>. Furthermore the data can be exported as DXF, and CSV text file. If the survey has a fixed station it can be exported as KML, and track file (PLT). This export fails if no the survey station is fixed. Finally you can export a ZIP archive with all the data of the survey.<br><p>

<h4>Delete dialog</h4>
The delete dialog ask for confirmation to delete the survey. Deleting the survey is unrecoverable: the survey and all associated data (photos, notes, sketch files, etc. ) except the zip archive. Make sure to export a backup ZIP archive before you delete the survey.<br><p>

<hr>
<i>Now you can go and take measurements in your cave, download the data to TopoDroid, assign the stations, and so on. After a few shots you probably need to do some sketching of the cave. Here comes the <u>Sketch</u> button. It displays the list of sketches for the survey. Unless you are very lucky and the cave is simple and straightforward you will need more than one sketch for the survey.</i><br><p>
