<h3>[8] SURVEY DATA WINDOW</h3>

<i>Back to the main window. The list of surveys is empty, but you are finally ready for your first survey. Tap on the <u>Add</u> button (the "plus" sign). You get a dialog to specify the survey information: <u>name</u>, <u>date</u>, <u>team</u>, <u>initial</u> survey station, magnetic <u>declination</u>, and a brief <u>description</u>.</i><br><p>

The survey name is mandatory. It must be unique in the database. The survey names are used to list surveys in the main window and TopoDroid distinguishes surveys by their name (although each survey has a unique numerical id in the database). The date is pre-filled with the current date. Team and description are empty (unless you have set a default team in the app settings). They can safely be left so, although it is a good practice to take the time to fill them. The magnetic declination is 0.0 by default. If you know it you can enter it here, otherwise you can look it up in the web after you have found the coordinates of a fixed point (say, the cave entrance) with the GPS [A].<br><p>

<b>WARNING.<br>
The name of the survey cannot contain the character '/' (slash), which is the pathname separator.<br>
The date must be written with format "yyyy.mm.dd". For example January 6, 2015 is "2015.01.06".</b><br><p>

Save when you are done, and the new survey name will appear in the list of surveys.  A long tap on a survey name opens the survey info dialog again. You can change any information. The survey name is special, because once the survey has been committed to the database, the name is used to refer to it. There is a menu to modify the survey name.<br><p>

If you tap shortly on the survey name the survey data activity starts.  This is one of the two most important activities of TopoDroid. The other is the Sketch activity.<br><p>

TopoDroid differentiates among four kinds of shots:
<ol>
<li>"blank" shots, ie, shots with the stations not set yet</li>
<li>"splay": it has only one station, usually the "From" station</li>
<li>"leg" (the first shot of a group of repeated measurements): this shot has both the "From" and the "To" station set</li>
<li>"repeated-leg" (the following shots of a group of leg shots): these shots do not need to have the stations set</li>
</ol><p>
Each kind of shots is displayed with a different color: "legs" are white, "repeated-legs" grey, "splays" blue, "blank" red. Furthermore the background color is blueish for the last downloaded shots, and reddish for "unreliable" shots, ie. shots with "abnormal" field intensities (only DistoX2).</br>
<img src="shots_list.png" alt="shots list"/><p>

The "reliability" of a shot is estimated by comparing the intensities of the magnetic and gravitational fields and the dip angle of the magnetic field with their averege values, respectively. If any of these differs from the average by more that a specified threshold, the shot is deemed "unreliable". The thresholds are among the app settings.<br><p>

<h4>MENUS</h4>
<ul>
<li><u>Survey info</u>: to open the survey information window</li>
<li><u>Recover</u>: to recover a deleted item (shot or sketch)</li>
<li><u>Photo</u> [A]: lists the pictures taken for this survey</li>
<li><u>Sensor</u> [A]: lists the sensor data taken for this survey</li>
<li><u>3D</u>: to display the survey in 3D (need the app </i>Cave3D</i>)</li>
<li><u>DistoX</u> [A]: opens the Device window</li>
<li><u>Settings</u></li>

</ul><br>

<h4>BUTTONS</h4>
<ul>
<li><u>Download</u>: it will download the data from the DistoX as in the calibration data window. If no DistoX is selected this button is hidden.</li>
<li><u>Bluetooth</u>: Opens the Bluetooth dialog that allows you to control the laser, take a measurement and download it, and reset the BT connection. If you experience problems with the DistoX after downloading some data, you may try to reset the bluetooth connection on TopoDroid, switch the DistoX on and off, and retry downloading the data.</li>
<li><u>Display</u>: to choose the display mode (see below)</li>
<li><u>Sketch</u>: opens the Sketch dialog where you can ask the program to create a new sketch or open an existing one. The dialog has a button to create a new sketch, and a two-column list of the current survey sketches (items in the left column open a sketch with its plan view, the right column items open sketches in profile view; once open in a view you can switch to the other from within the sketch window). If the 3D modelling is enabled there is also a button to create a new 3D model, and the existing 3D models are listed after the sketches. A long tap on the <u>Sketch</u> button opens immediately the most recent sketch, without going through the sketch list dialog.</li>
<li><u>Notes</u> opens the dialog to edit the annotations of the survey</li>
<li><u>Extend</u> opens the "Extend reference" dialog that defines how to set the "extend" for the coming shots (either downloaded or manually entered).</li>
<li><u>Stations</u> [N]: this buttons opens the dialog for the saved stations</li>
<li><u>Add</u> [N] adds a shot. In the coming dialog you must enter the shot stations and data (length, azimuth, and clino). You can specify also the direction of "extend", and values for LRUD. By default these are assumed at the FROM station, unless you check the box for the TO station.</li>
</ul><br><p>

<h4>SURVEY SETTINGS</h4>
<ul>
  <li><i>Team</i>: the default surveying team. If the value is not empty, it is used to set the "Team" field when you create a new survey. You can write your name and that of the cavers you usually survey with.</li>
  <li><i>Stations policy</i>: this tells the program how to automatically assign survey stations to the shots. (This is further explained below).</li>
  <li><i>Station names</i> specifies the type of the station names, either alphanumeric (default) or numeric [B].</li>
  <li><i>Initial station name</i>: the default first station name for new surveys. Can be also changed in the <i>New survey</i> dialog.</li>
  <li><i>Thumbnail size</i>: size of the photo thumbnails</li>
  <li><i>DATA UNITS >></i>
    <ul style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
    <li><i>Length units</i>: either meters or feet</li>
    <li><i>Angle units</i>: either degrees or grads</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i>SHOT DATA >></i>
    <ul style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
    <li><i>Leg tolerance</i>: the angular tolerance (percent) between consecutive shots to belong to the same leg</li>
    <li><i>Minimum leg shots</i>: minimum number of close consecutive shots that are takes as a leg. Further consecutive close shots are taken as belonging to the leg as well.</li>
    <li><i>Splay vertical threshold</i>: the "extend" direction assigned to a splay shot depends on the angle it makes with the leg(s). When the angle is closer than this value to 90 degrees the splay gets a "vertical extend". Otherwise it gets the same extend as the leg, or the opposite, depending whether the angle it makes with the leg is smaller or larger than 90 degrees.</li>
    <li><i>Leg vertical threshold</i>. this is like Therion "vthreshold": the LRUD for manually entered shots are considered West-East-North-South when the shot inclination exceeds the vertical threshold</li>
    <li><i>Settable extend reference</i>. The L/R extend reference can be either fixed (180 degrees) or adjustable.</li>
    <li><i>Loop closure</i>: whether to do the loop closure error compensation. It is advisable not to do the compensation, as this allows to see graphically the misclosures, and spot possible survey errors</li>
    <li><i>Backsight</i>: whether to add a line with fields for the backsight in the shot manual input dialog [N].</li>
    <li><i>Magnetic anomaly</i>: whether to compensate the local magnetic anomaly. It requires backsight auto-station policy.</li>
    <li><i>Timer</i> is the number of seconds before measuring the direction with the Android sensors (for "manual data-input" dialog [N], and for the "extend-reference" dialog))</li>
    <li><i>Beep volume</i> is the volume of the timer beep [N]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>  
  <li><i>LOCATION >></i>
    <ul style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
    <li><i>GSP Averaging</i>: whether to use the app GPSaveraging to locate fixed points [A]. By default this app is not used and the location is carried out by TopoDroid.</li>
    <li><i>Location units</i>: either dd.mm.ss or decimal degrees [A]</li>
    <li><i>C.R.S.</i> coordinate reference system [default is long-lat] (disabled)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>  
    <li><i>ACCURACY >></i>
    <ul style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
    <li><i>Acceleration tolerance</i>: tolerance on acceleration values above which a shot is signalled anomalous (only DistoX2)</li>
    <li><i>Magnetic tolerance</i>: tolerance on magnetic field values above which a shot is signalled anomalous (only DistoX2)</li>
    <li><i>Magnetic dip tolerance</i>: tolerance on magnetic dip angle values above which a shot is signalled anomalous (only DistoX2) [units degrees]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><br><p>

<h4>DISPLAY MODE</h4>
The <u>Display</u> button opens a dialog with choices for "shot id", "splay shots", "blank shots", and "repeated leg shots". The "shots id" are unique increasing indices assigned by TopoDroid to the shots of the survey. Splay shots can be shown or hidden. Blank shots can be either all shown or hidden. The same for repeated-leg shots.<br><p>

If the splay shots are hidden it is still possible to show the splay shots for an individual station. Tapping on the station name in a leg shot, makes the splay shots at that station visible. Tapping again on the station name (even in a splay shot) hides them.<br><p>

<h4>EXTEND REFERENCE [N]</h4>
When a new shot is downloaded TopoDroid sets its "extend" automatically. This holds also for shots entered manually, without specifying the "extend" in the shot dialog. By default the "extend" is either LEFT, RIGHT, or VERT (vertical), depending on the angle the shot makes with a reference azimuth. The "Extend Reference" dialog allows to change the reference azimuth, by rotating it clockwise or counterclockwise. Alternatively, the reference azimuth can be set using the Android compass sensors.<br><p>

It is also possible to fix the "extend" for coming shots to either LEFT or RIGHT, by selecting the appropriate buttons in the dialog.<br><p>

<h4>SAVED STATIONS [N]</h4>
The "saved stations" are stations saved for later reference, eg, at a crossway, to go back and continue the
survey from there, or to mark a possible lead to check in a future trip.
The dialog displays the list of saved stations. You select one by tapping it. 
The selected station is shown in the text fields. Initially there is the 
last station, or the current station if set.
Each saved station must have a brief description or comment.<br><p>

The buttons acts on the selected station: 
<ulis>
<li>clear the text boxes</li>
<li>save the station in  the text-box, if not already saved, or update the comment</li>
<li>set the current station to that in the text-box (or clear it, if the text-box is empty)</li>
<li>delete the saved station</li>
</ul><br><p>

<h4>DISTOX DATA DOWNLOAD [B]</h4>
The <u>Download</u> button starts a connection with the DistoX to download data.  While the connection is active it stays red. If you are using the "on-demand" download-mode the connection is closed when there are no more data to retrieve. With the "continuous" download-mode the connection remains open (and data are continuously downloaded as soon as the measurements are taken) until the DistoX and the Android lose the Bluetooth connection.  Which mode is best suited for you depends on your habits. With the on-demand mode you can concentrate on sketching and other tasks without being bothered by incoming data, and when you download the data you can focus on them (they are highlighted blue). On the other hand on-demand download requires pauses to get the data, and these are especially long if you took several shots in the between.<br><p>

If the Bluetooth connection with the DistoX is broken (eg. the DistoX gets too far from the Android, or it is switched off) the data download is interrupted. In continuous-mode, if the "Auto reconnect" setting is selected, TopoDroid retries to connect to the DistoX every few seconds.<br><p>

When the Shot activity is closed the data download connection is terminated. The download connection is not interrupted when the activity is paused (the display switches off). If you open a sketch while the download connection is active in "continuous" mode, the connection is maintained and the data are downloaded (and displayed in the sketch).<br><p>

<h4>MANUAL DATA INPUT [N]</h4>
If you do not have a DistoX you can still enter the shot data manually. 
Tapping the <u>Add</u> button opens the dialog for the shot data input. 
You must enter the station names and the shot data (length, azimuth, and clino).
Additionally you can type the LRUD, and select whether these refer to the FROM station or to the TO station.
The "compass" button sets the direction (azimuth and clino) using the Android sensors.
It has a timer (10 s by default) to allow you to point the device before measuring.
The "reverse" button allow to swap the stations, ie, reverse the shot.<br><p>

To add a splay shot enter "." (period) or "-" (dash) in the "To" station.
LRUD can be added to a splay shot, thus providing additional splay shots.
In this case the LRUD refer to the "From" station.<br><p>

The <u>Save</u> button at the bottom inserts the shot into the survey, and updates the station names incrementing them so that the dialog is ready to input the next shot. The <u>OK</u> button inserts the shot in the survey, and closes
the dialog. If LRUD are specified the respective splay shots are also inserted.<br><p>
