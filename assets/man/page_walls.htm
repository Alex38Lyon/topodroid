<h4>Auto-walls [E]</h4>

With auto-walls you tell TopoDroid to draw walls to the right and left of a shots interpolating through the end-points of the splays. At the moment there is only one mechanism, namely "convex" walls. A polyline is traced connecting the outermost end-points of the splays. To create a wall there must be at least one splay end-point on the side of the shot.<br><p>

Through the settings you can specify a limit to the inclination of the splays to take into account, and the amount of allowed concavity.<br><p>

<ul style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
    <li><i>Walls type</i>: the type of auto-walls. Default is "none" (disabled).</li>
    <li><i>Splay plan threshold</i>: inclination threshold for using splays in auto-walls in the plan view.</li>
    <li><i>Splay profile threshold</i>: inclination threshold for using splays in auto-walls in the profile view.</li>
    <li><i>Point separation</i>: minimum separation of splay points along the shot direction. If two splays are closer than this value only the soplay with largest distance from the shot is used.</li>
    <li><i>Point step</i>: maximum distance along the walls between two line-points. If a wall segment connecting two splays is too long it is splitted interpolating points</li>
    <li><i>Concavity</i>: amount of accetped concavity.</li>
</ul>
