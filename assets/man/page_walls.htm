<h4>Auto-walls [E]</h4>

With auto-walls you tell TopoDroid to draw walls to the right and left of a shots interpolating through the end-points of the splays. At the moment there is only one mechanism, namely "convex" walls. A polyline is traced connecting the outermost end-points of the splays. To create a wall there must be at least one splay end-point on the side of the shot.<br><p>

Through the settings you can specify a limit to the inclination of the splays to take into account, and the amount of allowed concavity.<br><p>
