<h2>TopoDroid v.2.5.4 User Manual</h2>
<i>2015-05-15 - marco.corvi@gmail.com</i><br><p>

TopoDroid is an Android app for cave surveying. TopoDroid takes the raw data and helps you to organize them, and produce the line map of the survey on the spot. You can further draw sketches around the line map while you are surveying, thereby reducing the probability of error entering in your sketch, and helping you to detect errors in the data while you are still in the cave. In this way a working map is almost ready as you are ending the survey trip.<br><p>

TopoDroid is designed to handle a survey at a time. It does not manage complex cave survey projects that include a number of different surveys. This is because the purpose of TopoDroid is to help a surveyor to collect the data with more accuracy as well as to make the surveying task more pleasant, not to produce the final map of the cave. For that purpose good PC programs already exist.<br><p>

TopoDroid is specifically designed to work with the DistoX, although survey data can be manually entered.<br><p>

Due to limited resources, the apk cannot be fully tested. It is advisable to install TopoDroid updates with an apk-manager that keeps the apk of previously installed versions. By this means you can safely revert to a version you are comfortable with, in case you find problems with the latest apk. Do not forget to report your problems so that they will be taken into account in the next version.<br><p>

The TopoDroid interface has activity levels, differing by the number of actions that are enabled.
<ulist>
<li>The <b>normal</b> level [N] contains all the functions for a detailed cave survey.</li>
<li>At the <b>basic</b> level [B] drawing is limited to lines, with no editing actions.</li>
<li>The <b>advanced</b> level [A] has all the functions.</li>
<li>The <b>experimental</b> level [E] is only for development. It has also the experimental features enabled. These features are partly debugged and may easily crash the app. Please report any problem with them.</li>
</ulist><br>
By default TopoDroid has only the <b>normal</b> functions enabled. This manual describes the complete TopoDroid. Features at a level above "basic" are marked with the level initial, [N], [A], or [E].<br><p>

TopoDroid uses a fixed portrait orientation of the screen.<br><p>
