<h4>Fixed station dialog</h4>

The "Fixed station" dialog is opened tapping a fixed station entry in the list if the "Location" dialog.<br><p>

The dialog shows
<ul>
<li>the longitude and latitude coordinates of the fixed station</li>
<li>the altitude over the WGS-84 ellipsoid</li>
<li>the altitude above mean sea level</li>
<li>the fixed station name</li>
<li>the magnetic declination at the fixed station position (at the current date)</li>
<li>a button to view the position with a Location app (provided you have one installed)</li>
<li>a button to convert the location to another reference system (using the app Proj4)</li>
<li>a button to delete the fixed station record</li>
</ul>

The orthometric altitude is computed from the ellipsoidic altitude using the geoid model EGM2008.<br><p>

The magnetid declination is computed using the World Magnetic Model for 2015-2020.
