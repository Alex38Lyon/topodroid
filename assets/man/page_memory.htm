<h4>DistoX memory</h4>

The <u>Memory</u> button of the Device window opens the "DistoX memory" dialog.<br><p>

You can retrieve the content of the DistoX memory, and even modify it if you have a DistoX1. The content of the DistoX memory is displayed in a list. Each line contains the memory location, a letter-code telling whether it is a shot ('d') or a calibration ('g') data, and the values. Entries without values are marked with a question-mark ('?') code. Shot values are shown as length (meters), azimut and clino (degrees). The "accuracy" data of the DistoX2 are not shown. For the calibration data, the raw values are shown ('m' data are not shown for the DistoX2).<br><p>

If you have entered a filename it is also saved to a dump file (in the "dump" folder), for analysis with other tools.<br><p>

This functionality is for recovery from desperate situations (eg, your android got lost but the data are still in the DistoX). Memory inspection requires some knowledge of the internals of the DistoX: at a minimum the address space, and the way data are stored. You should have read the DistoX documentation before using it.<br><p>

Reading the DistoX memory directly is a slow process. As this operation is carried out in the main gui thread, you have to be patient. It is advisable to read a portion of memory, say 100 entries, at a time.<br><p>
