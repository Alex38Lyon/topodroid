<h3>[9] SKETCH WINDOW</h3>

The Sketch button of the "Shot data" window opens the dialog with the list of sketches, besides the "New Sketch" button. Tap on this button to create a new survey sketch.<br><p>

Each sketch is made of two sketch files: one for the plan view, the other for the profile view (either extended or projected). Cross sections have only one file. A new sketch is opened in the plan view. Afterwards the sketch dialog shows two columns, one for the plan, the other for the profile view, and you can choose which one to open from.<br><p>

The plan view displays the projection on the horizontal plane of midline and splay shots. Splays above a certain inclination are shown as dashed lines. For example, for the plan view in figure, the splays in the light region are projected on the vertical plane of shot 1-2, those in the dark region on the vertical plane of 0-1.<br><p>  

The extended profile view displays the midline with the shots drawn left or right, or vertical, according to their "extend". Splays are projected on the vertical plane of the shot that is closest in azimuth.<br><p>

The projected profile view displays the midline and the splays projected in the vertical plane perpendicular to the projection azimuth.<br><p>

The sketch window has four modes:
</ul>
<li><b>move</b>, the default: you can shift the canvas, and zoom in/out. If the "fixed references" box in the references dialog is set, shifts affect only the drawings [level experimental]</li>
<li><b>draw</b>: in this mode you add iconic symbols (points, including labels), and trace lines and areas (closed regions filled with a color). At the basic level drawing is limited to lines.</li>
<li><b>erase</b>: to erase items, and lines/areas, or portions of them, from the sketch.</li>
<li><b>edit</b> [A]: for the fine editing. Shift and zoom are still available, as for the "move" mode.</li>
</ul><br><p>

Sketch shifting is possible even in <b>draw</b> and in <b>erase</b> mode using two fingers. Zoom controls can be enabled (either temporarily or permanently). If temporary, they show up when you tap at the bottom of the canvas in the middle. If "side-dragging" is enabled, the sketch can be shifted by "dragging" it from the left, right and bottom sides of the canvas.<br><p>


<h4>BUTTONS</h4>
The modes are represented by the three green buttons on the left: <u>draw</u>, <u>erase</u>, and <u>edit</u>. When none of them is "on" (has a white frame around) the mode is "move", otherwise it is that of the button that is "on".<br><p>

The remaining buttons differ by the mode. In the <b>move</b> mode they are
<ul>
<li>Data <u>Download</u>. The last download shots are bluish to help distinguish them from the others. If no DistoX is selected, this button is hidden.</li>
<li><a href="page_bluetooth.htm">Bluetooth</a> controls</li>
<li>Drawing <a href="page_drawing_refs.htm">references</a>: legs, splays, stations, and metric grid.</li>
<li><u>Plan/Profile</u> switch.</li>
<li><a href="page_azimuth.htm">"extend" reference</a></li>
<li><a href="page_survey_notes.htm">Notes</a></li>
</ul><br><p>

The <b>draw</b> mode has four buttons besides the green ones:
<ul>
<li><u>Undo</u> removes the last items you have drawn, one at a time.</li>
<li><u>Redo</u> puts the removed item back in the sketch, one at a time. The list of removed items is emptied when you draw something new. Pointwise editing actions may also affect the list of redo.</li>
<li><a href="page_tools_recent.htm">Drawing tool</a> picker</li>
<li>Line <u>continuation</u></li>
</ul><br><p>

The <b>erase</b> mode has the <u>Undo</u> and <u>Redo</u> buttons.<br><p>

The <b>edit</b> [A] mode has, besides the green buttons:
<ul>
<li><u>Previous</u> point in the selection</li>
<li><u>Next</u> point in the selection.</li>
<li><u>Point-wise</u> edit</li>
<li><u>Item</u> properties edit</li>
<li><u>Delete</u> the item from the sketch (it asks for confirmation, and can be "undone"). Long-tap: delete the item point.</li>
</ul><br><p>

<h4>MENUS</h4>
<ul>
<li><u>Export</u>: the sketch can be <a href="page_backup.htm">exported</a> as <i>Therion</i> 2D file(s), <i>cSurvey</i> (a single file), PNG (two files), DXF (two files), and SVG (two files).</li>
<li><a href="page_stat2.htm">Statistics</a>. For cross-sections this is just the section area.</li>
<li><u>Reload</u>: reloads the sketch from a <a href="page_backup.htm">backup copy</a>.</li>
<li><u>Delete</u>. Deleted sketches can be recovered</li>

<h4>SKETCH SETTINGS</h4>
<ul>
  <li><i>Drawing tool picker</i>: most-recent [default], or list, or grid, or triple-grid view</li>
  <li><i>Number of recent tools</i> to display in the recent tool picker [3, 4, 5, or 6]</li>
  <li><i>Side drag</i>: enable panning by side-dragging</li>
  <li><i>Zoom controls</i>: specifies whether and how zoom controls are displayed on multitouch devices [B]. The zoom controls can be hidden, displayed only for a short interval when the user tap the lower part of the screen in the middle, or shown all the time</li>
  <li><i>Midline check</i>: check if all the legs are attached to the midline</li>
  <li><i>xtherion areas</i> save sketch th2 files with an extra point in area borders</li>

<h4>Sketch cache</h4>
Once opened the sketches are kept in memory, in a cache. This speeds up switching between the shot-list window and the sketch window, as the sketch do not need to be read from file. The sketch cache is cleared when the survey is closed.<br><p>

<h4>Sketch file format</h4>
Each sketch is saved to file whenever it is modified, or when the sketch window changes to a different view.
For performance TopoDroid saves the sketches in its binary format.<br><p>

<h4>Point selection</h4>
To do some editing you must select a point: either a point item, a line/area point, a station, or a shot midpoint.<br>
To this aim you tap near the point you want. However if there are several points close where you tap, they are all selected, but only one of them is actively being edited. You change the "active" point among the selected set with the <u>Previous</u> and <u>Next</u> buttons.<br><p>

<h4>Line style</h4>
TopoDroid has four line styles. With the normal style [default] the lines are drawn as polylines. With the fine style the polyline segments are shorter, while with the coarse style they are longer. In the fourth style lines are interpolated replacing the segments with cubic Bezier curves. These segments pass through the two endpoints and have two control points used define the curvature.<br><p>

<h4>Line continuation</h4>
When the <u>Continuation</u> button is pressed, a line started close to the end of another line of the same type is considered as its continuation and is attached to that.<br>
Depending on a setting a new line is created, or the existing line is continued (and moved on top of the undo stack).<br><p>
 
<b>Warning. If the sketch disappear from the display, switch between plan and profile to force TopoDroid to reload it.</b><br><p>
