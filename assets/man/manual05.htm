<h3>[5] CALIBRATION DATA</h3>

The calibration data window displays the list of calibration data. If the
calibration has no data, the list is empty and the window shows only the top
buttons. Each data line contains the following data informations:
<ul>
<li>index: incremental index that identifies the data</li>
<li>group: number of the group the data belongs to</li>
<li>azimuth, inclination, and roll, computed from the raw values without any
calibration correction</li>
<li>error: the difference between the calibration-corrected direction and the
group average direction, in degrees</li>
</ul><br><p>

The calibration data are displayed with red and blue text-color, alternating between even and odd group numbers. Data with no group are grey.<br><p>

<h4>ACTIONS</h4>
<ul>
<li>tap on a data: calibration data edit dialog</li>
</ul><br><p>

<h4>BUTTONS</h4>
<ul>
<li><u>Download</u>: DistoX data download</li>
<li><u>Mode-toggle</u> toggles the DistoX calibration mode on and off</li>
<li><u>Groups</u> divides the calibration data into groups automatically.</li>
<li><u>Distribution</u> displays the angular data distribution.</li>
<li><u>Compute</u> computes the calibration coefficients and shows the result.</li>
<li><u>Read</u> displays the coefficients stored in the DistoX.</li>
<li><u>Write</u> writes the calibration coefficients to the DistoX. Enabled only after the calibration coefficients have been computed.</li>
</ul><br><p>

At the moment only on-demand data download is active for the calibration data. The downloaded data are added to the current calibration. Therefore you can take some calibration measurements, download the data, check if you are satisfied with them, if not take further data and download them, and so on until you are happy with your calibration data.  Downloaded data can be "disabled" (by setting the group number to "0" (zero); 
disabled data are not used in the computation of calibration coefficients), or deleted (usually not shown in the list of data).
Deleted data are not taken into account in the group assignment policy.<br><p>

<h4>MENUS</h4>
<ul>
<li><u>Display</u>: whether to display all data including the deleted data.</li>
<li><u>Settings</u>: same as for the calibration window.</li>
<li><u>Help</u></li>
</ul><br><p>

<hr>
<i>Basically you toggle your DistoX calibration mode on, take the measurements, download them, assign groups, check that the data cover all angles, compute the coefficients and write them to the DistoX. Your device is calibrated and ready for surveying. Turn the calibration mode off, and go back to the main window.</i><br><p>
