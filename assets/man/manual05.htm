<h3>[5] CALIBRATION DATA</h3>

The calibration data window displays the list of calibration data. If the calibration has no data, the window is empty but for the top buttons. Each calibration data line contains the following data informations:
<ul>
<li>index: incremental index that identifies the data</li>
<li>group: number of the group the data belongs to</li>
<li>azimuth, inclination, and roll, computed from the raw values without any
calibration correction</li>
<li>error: the difference between the calibration-corrected direction and the
group average direction, in degrees</li>
</ul><br><p>

The calibration data are displayed with red and blue text-color, alternating between even and odd group numbers. Data with no group are grey.<br><p>

<h4>ACTIONS</h4>
<ul>
<li>tap on a data: calibration data edit dialog</li>
</ul><br><p>

<h4>BUTTONS</h4>
<ul>
<li><u>Download</u> calibration data from the DistoX</li>
<li><u>toggle</u> the DistoX calibration mode on and off</li>
<li><u>Groups</u> divides the calibration data into <a href="page_groups.htm">groups</a> automatically</li>
<li><a href="page_calib_coeffs.htm">calibration coefficients</a> computation</li>
<li><a href="page_calib_distrib.htm">angular distribution</a> of the calibration data</li>
<li><u>Read</u> and display the coefficients stored in the DistoX</li>
<li><u>Write</u> writes the calibration coefficients to the DistoX. Enabled only after the calibration coefficients have been computed</li>
</ul><br><p>

At the moment only on-demand data download is active for the calibration data. The downloaded data are added to the current calibration. Therefore you can take some calibration measurements, download the data, check if you are satisfied with them, if not take further data and download them, and so on until you are happy with your calibration data.  Downloaded data can be "disabled" (by setting the group number to "0" (zero); 
disabled data are not used in the computation of calibration coefficients), or deleted (usually not shown in the list of data).
Deleted data are not taken into account in the group assignment policy.<br><p>

Warning. A message saying that there are "saturated" data means that the magnetic field has been detected with an
abnormal value.  A possible cause of this is the presence of spurious magnetic fields. Saturated data are denoted by a red
background.<br><p>

<h4>MENUS</h4>
<ul>
<li><u>Display</u>: whether to display all data including the deleted data</li>
<li><u>Validate</u>: <a href="page_validation.htm">validation</a> of this calibration with another one</li>
<li><u>Settings</u>: same as for the calibration window</li>
<li><u>Help</u></li>
</ul><br><p>
