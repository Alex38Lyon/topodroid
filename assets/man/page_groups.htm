<h4>Calibration data groups</h4>

The data in each group should have the same azimuth and inclination and differ only by the roll angle. There are three automatic grouping policies: four data at a time for each group; four-at-a-time for the first 16 data (four groups), then each data is a group by itself; grouping based on the relative angular distance (direction difference). The groups are identified by an integer number starting with "1" (one). Tapping on a data brings up a dialog where you can change the data group number. If you want to exclude a data from the computation of the calibration enter the number "0" (zero). Deleted items are excluded from the computation of the calibration coefficients.<br><p>
