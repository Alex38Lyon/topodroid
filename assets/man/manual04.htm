<h3>[4] MAIN WINDOW</h3><p>

The main window has three (or five) buttons at the top, and 
the list of the surveys underneath. This list is empty until you create a survey.
The first time you start the app a welcome message is shown. You can go back to it any time later with the <u>About</u> menu.<br><p>

To exit TopoDroid main window double tap on the <i>BACK</i> button of your device.<br><p>


<h4>MENUS</h4>
<ul>
<li><u>Palette</u> allows to choose the drawing tools that are enabled. TopoDroid has many drawing tools, several of which you might not need. Having only the relevant ones enabled in the palette, makes faster to switch among them in the <u>Tool Picker</u> dialog.</li>
<li><u>Cosurvey</u> [E] opens the dialog to connect with the TopoDroid app on another Android to make a join-surveying [experimental level only].</li>
<li><u>Settings</u>. With this you can choose all the program settings: the global ones and those of surveying, sketching, calibrating, and devices. There are many adjustable settings. The default values should be reasonable enough. One thing you might want to change are the "display units" for lengths; you can choose between meters (default) and feet. Beware that this is just a unit conversion in the display; internally, in the database, TopoDroid stores lengths in meters. Other settings you might want to change are the buttons and texts sizes, and the drawing units.</li>
<li><u>Logs</u> [E] allows to decide what to log and whether to save to the system log or to a file (in the TopoDroid directory). By default logs are sent to the system log and only error messages are logged. Logging is mostly for debugging [experimental level only]</li>
<li><u>About</u>: the program welcome message</li>
<li><u>Help</u> shows a brief descriptions of buttons and menus. At the top-right corner there is a button that opens this user manual. Each TopoDroid window has a similar <u>Help</u> menu.</li>
</ul><br><p>

<h4>BUTTONS</h4>
<ul>
<li><u>Device activity</u> (DistoX icon): switches to the Device (management) window</li>
<li><u>Add</u> (a plus sign): used to create a new survey</li>
<li><u>Import</u> (a vertical arrow): used to import ZIP archives created with TopoDroid or survey files (<i>Therion</i>, <i>Compass</i>, <i>VisualTopo</i>, or <i>PocketTopo</i>).</li>
<li>The optional buttons [E] are for the <i>ThManager</i> (Therion manager) and the <i>SQLite viewer</i>; both require external apps</li>
</ul><br><p>

<h4>SETTINGS</h4>
<ul>
<li><i>Work directory</i> sets the current work directory. By default this is "TopoDroid", but it can be changed to another directory in the primary external memory.</li>
<li><i>Language</i>. The available languages are: English, French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish and Bulgarian. If no language is selected the system language is used (or English).</li>
<li><i>Text size</i> of items in the lists</li>
<li><i>Buttons size</i>, either "small" or "large". The small buttons are suitable to a 5" screen. You might want to switch to large buttons if you use a 7" tablet.</li>
<li><i>Keyboard</i>: whether to enable or disable the TopoDroid keypads.</li>
<li><i>Activity level</i>: TopoDroid has four activity levels, differing in the amount of functions that are enabled. The default level ("normal") provides the most common functions. In this way the interface can be kept free of unnecessary buttons (and menus). </li>
<li><i>Cosurveying</i> [E] activate/deactivate the cosurveying service (very experimental).</li>
</ul><br><p>

<h4>Survey import</h4>
The <u>Import</u> button opens a dialog listing files that can be imported in the app.
TopoDroid can import the survey files in the followng formats:
<ul>
<li><i>Therion</i>: ".th" data files, with simple data format ("normal from to length compass clino" and optionally LRUD).
Therion scrap are not imported.</li>
<li><i>Compass</i> ".dat" files (not fully tested)</li>
<li><i>VisualTopo</i> ".tro" files (not fully tested)</li>
<li><i>PocketTopo</i> ".top" files. Data and drawings are imported (not fully tested)</li>
<li>TopoDroid ZIP archives. These are special zip files with the informations to repopulate the database, the drawings (".th2" files), the annotation file, and the photos.</li>
</ul><br>
Zip archives are searched in the "zip" directory (that is where TopoDroid saves them). Survey files are searched in the "import" directory. Therefore you must copy the survey file you want to import in this directory. If the survey name of the file to import already exists in the database the file is not imported.<br><p>

<hr>
If <b>bluetooth</b> is not on, the app asks whether to turn it on. Without bluetooth it cannot communicate with the DistoX and the survey data can only be entered manually. In this case the <i>Download</i> button in the Shot window is hidden, and that in the Sketch window is replaced by the <i>Add</i> button.<br><p>

When the app starts the first time it installs the drawing tools files in the "symbol" directory. There are files for points (iconic symbols, like "entrance", or "stalagmite"), lines (like "wall", or "pit"), and areas (regions shown with a transparent color). If you have upgraded the app to a new version it asks if you want to reinstall the drawing tools.<br>
Even if TopoDroid comes with many drawing tools preinstalled (45 points, 15 lines, and 9 areas), it can happen that it does not contains the tools you need (or you do not like the one provided). The tool files are plain text files, and you can write your own tool file(s). After you put them in the symbol subdirectories, TopoDroid will see and use them. The syntax of the tool files is described in a page on the speleoapps website.<br><p>
