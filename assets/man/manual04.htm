<h3>[4] CALIBRATION WINDOW</h3>

Tapping the <u>Calibration</u> menu in the Device activity window takes to the Calibrations dialog, which lists the calibrations of the current DistoX.<br><p>

To create a new calibration tap on the <u>New Calibration</u> button in the dialog. This brings you to the window for the calibration informations. The "date" field is prefilled with the current date. The "device" field is prefilled with the address of the DistoX, and cannot be modified. You must give a "name" to the calibration. The name is what appears in the list of calibrations. You can optionally enter a brief "description". By default TopoDroid will pick automatically the calibration algorithm based on the DistoX model and firmware. However you can force it to use either the linear or the non-linear algorithm. When you are done tap the <u>Save</u> button (the leftmost) to save the calibration info to the database.<br><p>

<b>WARNING. The name of the calibration must not contain the character '/' (slash), which is the pathname separator.</b><br><p>

When you open an existing calibration (tapping the calibration name in the list of the calibration of a DistoX), you get the same interface.  The only difference is that the name of the calibration is no more editable.<br><p>

<h4>BUTTONS</h4>
<ul>
<li><u>Save</u> saves the calibration informations to the database</li>
<li><u>Open</u> opens the calibration data window</li>
<li><u>Read</u> [A] displays the calibration coefficients. This shows the values of the calibration coefficients previouly computed, and stored in the database</li>
</ul><br><p>

<h4>MENUS</h4>
<ul>
<li><u>Export</u> The calibration data can be exported as a CSV text file that can be imported in a spreadsheet program</li>
<li><u>Delete</u> removes the calibration informations and its data from the database. This is a non-recoverable action.</li>
<li><u>Settings</u></li>
<li><u>Help</u></li>
</ul><br><p>

<h4>CALIBRATION SETTINGS</h4>
<ul>
<li><i>Group policy</i>: how to split the calibration data into <a href="page_groups.htm">groups</a>.</li>
<li><i>Group tolerance</i>: the maximum angular distance between consecutive data for them to be in the same group when the "distance-based" group-policy is used</li>
<li><i>Error</i>: the computation of the coefficients ends if the variation of every coefficient during an iteration step is smaller than this value [10<sup>-6</sup>].</li>
<li><i>Iterations</i>: the maximum number of iteration of the calibration algorithm [200].</li>
<li><i>Raw data</i>: whether to display the raw data. By default TopoDroid displays the azimuth, inclination, and roll. Check this option if you want to see also the raw calibration data</li>
<li><i>Algorithm</i>: can be 0 (auto), 1 (linear), 2 (non-linear). If a calibration algorithm is left "auto", and this setting is not "auto", then the algorithm of the settings is used to calculate the calibration. If they are both "auto" the algorithm is chosen automatically by TopoDroid depending on the DistoX model and firmware.</li>
