<h4>Survey data display mode</h4>
The <u>Display</u> button in the "shot list" window opens a dialog with choices for which shots to diaplay
in the list and how:
<ul>
<li>shot id</li>
<li>splay shots</li>
<li>blank shots</li>
<li>repeated leg shots</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

The <b>shot id</b>s are unique increasing indices assigned by TopoDroid to the shots of the survey.<br><p>
  
<b>Splay shots</b> can be shown or hidden. If the splay shots are hidden it is still possible to show the splay
shots for an individual station. Tapping on the station name in a leg shot, makes the splay shots at that station visible.
Tapping again on the station name (even in a splay shot) hides them.<br><p>
  
<b>Blank shots</b> can be either all shown or hidden.<br><p>

<b>repeated-leg shots</b> can be either shown or hidden.<br><p>
