<h4>DISPLAY MODE</h4>
The <u>Display</u> button opens a dialog with choices for "shot id", "splay shots", "blank shots", and "repeated leg shots". The "shots id" are unique increasing indices assigned by TopoDroid to the shots of the survey. Splay shots can be shown or hidden. Blank shots can be either all shown or hidden. The same for repeated-leg shots.<br><p>

If the splay shots are hidden it is still possible to show the splay shots for an individual station. Tapping on the station name in a leg shot, makes the splay shots at that station visible. Tapping again on the station name (even in a splay shot) hides them.<br><p>
