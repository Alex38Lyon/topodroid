<h4>DistoX DEVICE SELECT</h4>

TopoDroid can work with more than one DistoX at once, although data are downloaded from one DistoX at a tine.<br>

All DistoX's must be paired with the Android, and the <i>data download mode</i> must be set to </i>multi</i>.
In this case when you long-tap the <i>download</i> button you get a dialog to choose from which DistoX to download the data.<br><p>
