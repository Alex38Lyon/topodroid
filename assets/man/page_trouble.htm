<h4>DistoX troubleshooting</h4>
If the scan for new DistoX devices fails to show your DistoX, you may try a scan with the <i>Settings</i> app. If this app too fails to find the DistoX, there is some problem with the bluetooth on your Android, and you will not be able to use TopoDroid with a DistoX.<br>
You can also use the <i>Settings</i> app to pair the DistoX.<br>
Once paired with the DistoX, the Android should keep the pairing, and not request the PIN again. If it keeps requesting the PIN every time you download data from the DistoX, try to use the "insecure" socket.<br>
If you have problem connecting and downloading the data try to enable the "Z6 workaround".<br>
