<h4>Language</h4>
By default TopoDroid uses the system default language if TopoDroid contains the proper translation. Otherwise English is used. You can override this choice selecting another language among the supported ones: English, Bulgarian, French, German, Italian, Russian, and Spanish.<br><p>

The choice of the language is one of the general settings of the app.<br><p>
