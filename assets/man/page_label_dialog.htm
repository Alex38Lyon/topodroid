<h4>Drawing label</h4>

This dialog is opened when you insert a label (in drawing mode of the <i>Sketch</i> window).<br><p>

Label properties:
<ul>
<li><b>size</b>: one of XS, S, M, L, XL</li>
<li><b>text</b></li>
<li><b>layers</b> [T]</li>
<li>additional Therion <b>options</b></li>
</ul>
<br><p>

By default labels belongs to all the layers.
It is possible to switch off some layers.
Beware that, if the label is not assigned to a visible layer, it will not appear in the canvas
even if it is actually added to the sketch.
<br><p>

Labels are orientable.<br><p>
