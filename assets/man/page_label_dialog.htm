<h4>Drawing label dialog</h4>

You open the "Drawing label" dialog when you select the basepoint of the label (in editing mode of the "Sketch" window),
and tap the "Edit" button (the "note and pencil").<br><p>

This dialog lets you edit the text and the properties of the label.
At the moment the only label property managed by TopoDroid is the label size (one of XS, S, M, L, XL).
There is also a text field where you can enter other Therion attributes of the label. This field is treated opaquely by TopoDroid, which writes is on the line of the "point label" in the Therion export.
